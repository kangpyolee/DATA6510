However, there are actually some important use cases where one might not want to use a SQL-based solution. Even when SQL is the right decision there are plenty of options to choose from that fit some use cases better than others. \n",
        "\n",
        "In Lesson 5 we discussed four basic design priorities:\n",
        "- Minimizing Storage Space\n",
        "- Maximizing Calculation Speed\n",
        "- Maximizing Coherency\n",
        "- Minimizing Data Corruption Risk\n",

        "\n",
        "Here are four considerations that underlie any database technology decision:\n",
        "- **Flexibility / Developer Experience**  \n",
        "  How easy is it for developers to learn and use the technology? It may make sense to use technology that is closer to what your programmers use everyday. \n",
        "- **Scalability / Performance Speed and Cost**  \n",
        "  There is a natural tradeoff between speed and cost. Technology that works at Big Data Scale makes that tradeoff explicit. How much does each GB of storage cost? How about each GB/sec of query throughput? If we are willing to wait a little longer for each query can we save some money? \n",
        "- **Consistency / Timeliness**  \n",
        "  Data is worthless if it is not available when you need it. If we don't need data to be instantaneously available, how long can we wait? If we need the data right now, then how tolerant are we of anomalies and other imperfections? If we use data replication to speed up access, do we need all copies to be 100% consistent? \n",
        "- **Technical Maturity / Technical Debt**  \n",
        "  Database technology is always evolving, with new solutions coming out all the time. The newest technology may score well on the above considerations but also may come with bugs and other problems that need to be worked out. Meanwhile, older technology may be rock solid but also may limit your choices going forward. There is always the risk of being stuck with obsolete technology while your competition is beating you with something newer. \n",

        "The term \"NoSQL\" was first coined in the late 1990s and gained popularity among application programmers about a decade later. It refers to databases that do not rely on the relational model. That does not mean that SQL (or some close approximation) isn't used, but rather, that NoSQL systems extend beyond the traditional relational model. \n",
        "\n",
        "For this reason some interpret NoSQL as \"Not only SQL\" rather than exclusively no use of SQL at all. In fact, each of the NoSQL technologies surveyed here *could* in fact be implemented in SQL, and we will try to use relational models to explain how each relates to SQL and how it extends beyond it. \n",

        "Why would we even need to go beyond SQL? \n",
        "- **Developer Experience (DX):** As we have discussed before, there is a natural impedance mismatch between a declarative language like SQL and a more imperative application development language like Python, Java, or JavaScript. NoSQL technologies remove much of the discomfort some programmers feel when using SQL.\n",

Semi-structured data has a schema (so we can interpret and process it), just like any other data model, but not one we can know about in advance. Specifically, in a document store each document (roughly equivalent to a table row) can have its own schema, structuring the data however it likes. We can then only know a document schema *after* opening the document, whereas for the relational model all table schemas are known *before* doing any DML operation. \n",
        "\n",
        "The classic example of a document storage format is that used by Microsoft Word, which acts as a *container* for components (blocks of text, titles, images, tables, etc.). One can insert just about anything inside an MS Word file (even malware, unfortunately). MS Word will then compose and render the components as documents in real time so end users can read and edit the data contained inside. \n",

        "A more relevant example is JSON, which has become the de facto standard format for transmitting data over the web. Like with an MS Word document, a JSON object or list acts as a container, into which we can insert ... JSON objects and lists.

        "- Whereas a relational database treats relationships as being between entity types, graph databases define them on specific node pairs. **Any pair of nodes can be connected by an edge, regardless of type.** \n",
        "- While each node has a unique identifier, there is no concept of type-based foreign keys. Instead, **each edge is treated like an entity with a unique identifier.** The edge then has two implicit properties to reference the nodes it connects. \n",

For some applications a graph database can be much, much faster than a relational database. For example, consider the database behind the [Six Degrees of Kevin Bacon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Six_Degrees_of_Kevin_Bacon) game, where each working actor has a *Bacon Number*, BN, that represents the number of edges needed to connect them to Kevin Bacon. Kevin Bacon's BN is 0. Anyone who has appeared in a movie with him has a BN of 1. Anyone who has appeared with anyone whose BN=1 has a BN of 2, etc. The game is to guess an obscure actor's BN, with super bonus points for finding a movie actor *anywhere in the world* without a BN. \n",

        "Now for the subtle part. If we want to include a calculated column, say the difference between two other columns in the same row, then we'd do something like this:\n",
        "```sql\n",
        "SELECT column_b - column_a AS b_minus_a \n",
        "FROM ... ;\n",
        "```\n",
        "That seems simple enough. We can also, of course, use `GROUP BY` to calculate subtotals within a given column if we like:\n",
        "```sql\n",
        "SELECT sum(column_a) as subtotal_a\n",
        "FROM ...\n",
        "GROUP BY column_b;\n",
        "```\n",
        "In both cases we are performing a calculation over *nonoverlapping* groups of rows and columns (i.e., either within each row or aggregated within predefined groups of rows).\n",
        "\n",
        "However, what if we need to calculate differences between each row and *the one above it*? Then it gets more complicated, *because the groups overlap*. Not even `GROUP BY` can help us with that, unless we somehow make each row and the one above it a group, which seems highly inefficient at best. We'll instead have to dig deeper into our bag of tricks: \n",
        "- Join a table to itself using some sort of lag logic on the keys:\n",
        "```\n",
        "SELECT t2.column_a - t1.column_a AS diff_a_lag_1\n",
        "FROM table AS t1 JOIN table AS t2 ON (t1.id = t2.id + 1)\n",
        "```\n",
        "- Use Python or another programming language to do the work. pandas has the `shift()` method just for such a purpose. You merge one table with a shifted version of itself. If you go this route, of course, you will need SQL to read the input data and then write the calculations back to the database afterwards. That's a nontrivial solution to say the least.  \n",
        "- Use a SQL **window function**, which operates vertically within a column instead of laterally within a row. \n",
        "\n",
        "For most use cases, window functions will be your best choice. \n",
        "\n",
        "Window functions are used in the `SELECT` and `ORDER BY` clauses to aggregate longitudinal data *without a `GROUP BY` clause*. Instead of the traditional grouping operation, the expression being calculated specifies a *sliding window* of rows, anchored by the current row. The syntax is \n",
        "```sql\n",
        "expression OVER ( window_selector )\n",
        "```\n",
        "The `window_selector` specifies what rows to include and can use pretty sophisticated selection criteria like any of the following:\n",
        "- X rows before and Y rows after the current row\n",
        "- All rows before the current row\n",
        "- All rows where column X is within some range of Z in the current row\n",
        "- X rows before and Y rows after, sorted by the value of Z\n",
        "\n",
        "The window function partitions the rows (much like `GROUP BY`) based on the given criteria and then calculates the expression based on the current row. The expression is almost always an aggregation function like `SUM()` or `AVG()`, of which there are too many to list here. There are even special ones like [`STRING_AGG()`](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/reference/standard-sql/functions-and-operators#string_agg) that work with non-numeric data types. \n",

Among other things this means that attributes should be singular, represeting just one fact about a given entity. Plural attributes, meanwhile, should be normalized out into one-to-many relationships to new entity types. \n",

        "The `ARRAY` and `STRUCT` collection types (details below) were added to the SQL standards in a wave of enthusiasm for object-relational features in SQL:1999 but then (like window functions) largely ignored by most database vendors until 2018. Why ignore the standard? Because collection types permit us to skirt around a fundamental law of normalization: thou shalt not use repeated fields. \n",
        "\n",
        "In fact, it is not a good idea to use these sorts of collection types in a transactional database, where vigilance is needed to keep the data consistent and anomaly free. However, for dimensional data warehouses, where the **dimension tables** are often denormalized anyway, they make **perfect sense**: no extra joins, no redundant columns, etc., just the relevant context in a concise format.  \n",
        "\n",
        "> **Heads Up**: Collection types are generally **not a good fit for fact tables** because they complicate the aggregation logic. What does a **measure** (i.e., fact) mean when it can be multi-valued? How do you sum or average a list of lists? \n",
        "\n",
        "***Technically*, collection types do not actually violate normalization rules.** A collection is a **container** that can hold structured data. The container itself is singular, though the contents might be plural. It's like how you might keep a plastic *container* of cut celery sticks instead of storing them in a pile on the shelf. The container is *one* thing (with the sticks nested inside), but you have to open the container (unpack it) to get your snack. That's exactly how SQL `ARRAY` and `STRUCT` work. We have to use functions and special syntax to pack and unpack data. Otherwise, SQL just treats it like an image or other binary data. Of course, it *is* still a problem that we don't know what's inside the container before we unpack it but we can still say the table itself is 1NF. \n",
