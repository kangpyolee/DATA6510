Suddenly you pay attention to things like grammar and spelling because without them being just like what's in the book you are lost. You find yourself needing people to speak very, very slowly so you can transliterate what you hearing in real time. Then, slowly, you start to get a more intuitive feel for things. You can go a little faster, fill in the gaps when the grammar and spelling aren't exactly perfect,... Eventually, if you stick with it you can even start to think in the language almost as well as a native speaker. Then, if you are really diligent, you start to speak totally unconsciously, sometimes forgetting what language you are speaking. (One way to tell someone is a natively bilingual speaker is when they are in a mixed crowd. If they get their languages crossed, so that they speak exactly the rwong language to each person, then you know the person is natively bilingual.)\n","\n","So it is with data. We learn about data by working with datasets, learning conventions like data structures and data types, without really thinking about it much. Data is data, or so we think. Then we come across *foreign* data that doesn't obey all the rules we have been taking for granted. It is then that we *really* start to understand how data works. \n","\n","None of this was new to the people who developed SQL. The language has been around so long and had to be warped to fit so many use cases that there really isn't much it can't handle *with planning and effort*.  \n","\n","In this lesson we will consider some of the many ways to combine data from multiple tables in SQL. Sometimes the integration is pretty straightforward. Sometimes it will take some work and perhaps a few carefully crafted subqueries. And, of course, sometimes it just doesn't work and trying to make it work is just futile and potentially risky. Hopefully, by the end of this lesson you will be able to recognize each case and know what to do.

Each time a row is added to the table the surrogate key value *incremented* by 1, causing the rows to be numbered in sequential order. The keys values are never reused.

JOIN`, `LEFT JOIN`, and `RIGHT JOIN`**\n","\n","SQL joins have a *directional* component that can be useful in certain situations. Every join we have seen so far is an *inner* join, which is the default. Thus, we rarely see `INNER JOIN` used but we can if we want to be explicit about it. \n","\n","A so-called *outer* join can take on one of two directions:\n","- **Left join:** `TableA LEFT JOIN TableB` includes every row from `TableA` (to the left of the `JOIN`) and only the matching rows from `TableB` (to the right of the join).\n","- **Right join:** `TableA RIGHT JOIN Table B` is the reverse, including every row from `TableB` but only matching rows from `TableA`. \n","\n","**Heads up:** Some DBMSes like Google BigQuery, Oracle , and SQL Server also support a more general `FULL OUTER JOIN` syntax that combines the left and right joins, allowing every row from both tables to appear at least once. MySQL and SQLite do not support full outer joins, so **we will stick to left and right joins in this course.** \n","\n","Outer joins are often used when we allow NULL values in foreign keys.

If, for example, we use a join to add a second table to our query, we get access to all its columns as well. Similarly, when we add a subquery in the `SELECT` or `FROM` clauses we are adding more columns into the mix. \n","\n","The `UNION`, `INTERSECT` and `EXCEPT` operators are row-oriented. They never add any columns. Instead, they add or subtract rows. We will get into this more in Lesson 4, but the key concept is that **a table is a *set* of rows.** With the set theoretic operators we can add rows or delete rows from a row set but we can't modify the rows themselves. Each row always has the same number of columns. \n","\n","**Heads up:** SQL operators *never* alter data. Thus the examples below do not change any table data; they apply the operators to generate a new result set, not a table. If we want to *create a new table* then we will need SQL DDL, which is covered in Lesson 7. If we want to *alter* table data then we will need SQL DML, which is covered in Lesson 8. \n","\n","We'll take the set operators one at a time.\n","\n","The `UNION` operator adds two `SELECT` queries:\n","```\n","SELECT ...\n","UNION\n","SELECT ...\n","```\n","For example, the following query forms the union of the `Batting` table and the `BattingPost` table:\n","```\n","SELECT * FROM Batting\n","UNION\n","SELECT * FROM BattingPost\n","```\n","The top and bottom queries have the same number and types of columns, making them **union-compatible**.  While the names of the columns don't have to match, the number of columns has to be the same and the data types of corresponding columns (first column, second column, etc.) have to have the same data types. If the second column in the top query is integer-values then the second column of the lower query also has to be integer-valued. The column names themselves always come from the top query, ignoring the names in the bottom query.\n","\n","The `INTERSECT` operator syntax is exactly the same as the `UNION` syntax. However, instead of adding rows, it returns only the rows that are in both the top and the bottom queries. \n","\n","The `EXCEPT` operator also has a top query and a bottom query, both union-compatible with the other. This time, however, `EXCEPT` only returns the rows in the top query that *are not* found in the bottom query. It is like taking the difference between the two tables. \n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"www2vN5LTlDo"},"source":["---\n","## **PRO TIPS: How to write queries correctly the first time, every time**\n","It's pretty easy to tell a novice SQL coder from a seasoned veteran. The novice always starts typing long queries from the top, working through the clauses one at a time until they reach the bottom. Then they run the query and 99% of the time it fails. SQL will give some sort of cryptic error message $-$ nobody knows what they mean half the time $-$ and then the novice spends 45 minutes or so staring at the code trying to spot the error.\n","\n","There are lots of problems with this approach. Here are a few:\n","- Is there really just one bug? SQL will only report the first fatal error it finds. There may be many more bugs to fix before your code works. \n","- Any time spent staring at the screen is not actually producing working code.\n","- Where do you start to fix the error? Sometimes a bug is spread over several lines; each line is \"correct\" but the combination of lines with each other is fatally wrong. \n","- Sometimes you don't get an error message at all. Instead, the query just runs forever, until it bricks the server (and your professor gives you an F for destroying everybody's homework). Or, the query just returns nothing, a result set with zero rows. \n","\n","A seasoned veteran seemingly never makes these kinds of mistakes. Every query seems to work all the time. Your humble professor has gone entire semesters without having a live SQL bug in a class demo. It can be done! It just takes the discipline to follow the *right* process and the courage to tear apart code that doesn't work. No code is sacred. Sometimes you have to break things before you can fix them. \n","\n","Okay, so what is the process?\n","1. Start with the simplest possible query that does pretty much nothing. Run it to make sure that the SQL runtime is working and that you haven't made a trivial mistake like leaving out the second `E` in `SELECT` or forgotten the semicolon at the end. \n","2. Code the most difficult, most likely to fail, part of the query, making whatever minimal changes to the rest of the query so that it will run. Then run it to make sure you didn't mess up. \n","3. Code the next most difficult ... \n","4. Repeat until the query works. \n","\n","Yes, that really is it! Instead of writing a huge query all at once, write in chucks that can be tested and debugged as you go along. You will write *more total lines of SQL code* but each change will be small and easy to get right before moving on.\n","\n","Let's apply this to a fairly complicated like query this one:\n","```\n","SELECT nameLast,nameFirst, Batting.AB, Batting.H, Batting.H/Batting.AB AS `Batting Average`\n","FROM Master \n","  JOIN Batting ON (Master.playerID = Batting.playerID)\n","  JOIN Teams ON (Batting.teamID = Teams.teamID AND Batting.yearID = Teams.yearID)\n","  JOIN TeamsFranchises ON (Teams.franchID = TeamsFranchises.franchID)\n","WHERE franchName like 'Boston Red%' AND Batting.`yearID` = 1986;\n","```\n","\n","Even with the code printed out in front of you, if you were to type it in from top to bottom you would almost certainly have a typo or other error in your code. So, let's not even try to do that. Let's apply our process. \n","\n","We'll start with the simplest possible code that does as little as
