So, data modeling is about what we will do with the data and what we can expect to find as we collect it. The data itself ends up being a collection of artifacts that gets us from data collection to data usage. \n","\n","So, whenever we start design of a new database (i.e., the receptacle for our data) the most important questions are:\n","- What exists now?\n","- What is the data about?\n","- What is the data going to be used for?\n","- How long does the data need to be kept?\n","- Who is going to use the data? \n","\n","Only after we get answers to these questions can we begin to think about the tables, columns, keys, constraints, etc. For example, let's consider the \"What exists now?\" question. What exists now may include any or all of the following: \n","- a paper process used to collect dead tree data and produce reports\n","- people whose jobs are to work with the current data sources every day, perhaps with an organizational hierarchy that determines data access permissions\n","- online systems that need data in a specific format or produce data in a (not necessarily the same) format\n","- end users that don't currently know they need the data \n","- a laundry list of complaints about the current system (or lack of one)\n","- ...\n","It goes on and on. \n","\n","The purpose of data modeling is to capture enough detail about the data requirements as possible before we make any technology decisions we might regret later. If, for example, we find that some data needs to be separate from other data because of different sources or user access permissions, then we need to take that into account when designing our tables. Similarly, if some data is permanent and other data is only useful for a couple of weeks, then perhaps we will want to keep them separate as well. \n","\n","In this lesson we will use Entity Relationship Modeling to capture data requirements in an intuitive way that can be explained to clients and power users. It is like writing a draft of the user manual for the data before anything else.

Peter Chen first developed the theory in the mid-1970s, a time when relational databases were still pretty exotic, to solve a serious conceptual problem. People understood how to read and write files but following all the rules needed to build relational databases was a challenge.  \n","\n","ER diagrams (ERDs) are designed to be just specific enough to be useful without introducing any unnecessary details that are best left for later. Consider this ERD from Lesson 1:\n","\n","![Cleaners ERD](https://github.com/christopherhuntley/BUAN6510/raw/master/img/L6_erd1.png)\n","\n","- **Each box represents an entity class or type.** Any given type can model any number of instances. So, for example, the `Customer` entity (type) can represent millions of customers (instances). \n","- **The attributes are listed inside the box.** Traditionally, primary key attributes (identifiers like `customer_id`) are listed at the top and the foreign key attributes at the bottom, with non-key attributes in between. If an attribute is both a primary key and foreign key then group it with the primary keys attributes. \n","  > Note: in the earliest stages of the design process, we may omit the attributes entirely, focusing on just the entities and relationships.  \n","- **Relationships are shown with lines connecting the boxes.** The notation at each end of a connecting line represents how many entity instances there are at that end. The relationship shown in the diagram indicates that:\n","  - each `Customer` instance can generate zero of more `Invoice` instances\n","  - each `Invoice` instance is generated by one and only one `Customer`\n","\n","With this much detail we can say:\n","- what tables we will need in the database\n","- what columns are on each table\n","- what foreign keys are needed and what tables they refer to\n","\n","What we don't care about (yet) includes \n","- the data types of the attributes\n","- how the keys are generated and managed\n","- how many rows of data are to be in each table\n","- how the tables will be populated with data\n","- how data will be updated or deleted from the tables\n","\n","These things are for logical design. For now we are just interested in the general database structure, not its implementation. We need to get the basic concepts right before diving into the details. \n","\n"," \n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"EDSvJAd3atPB"},"source":["## **ERDs as Conceptual Storytelling**\n","\n","The key insight of entity relationship modeling $-$ the one that makes it so useful for database design $-$ is that **databases exist to tell stories**. They describe things that people care about enough to record for later. Entity-relationship diagramming is a visual language for telling database stories before we actually have data.\n","\n","In the visual language of ERDs there are just two kinds of sentences:\n","- Description: entity A **is described by** attributes X, Y, and Z \n","- Action: entity A **acts upon** entity B\n","\n","In these stories, the **entities and attributes are the descriptive nouns**, while the **relationships are the action verbs**. \n","\n","We will take these one at a time and then discuss some of the more interesting special cases. \n","\n","\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"_AYIvnUVaYuB"},"source":["## **Entities and Attributes**\n","\n","In principle, any particular thing could be considered an entity or an attribute. Often it's hard to tell which, at least at first, before we know the context for our database stories. \n","\n","The difference between an entity and an attribute is that entities always have a unique identity within the **domain model** (i.e., context). Recall that in Lesson 4 we defined the relational model using set mappings from **domains** to **codomains**: \n","![Relation mappings from Lesson 4](https://github.com/christopherhuntley/BUAN6510/raw/master/img/L4_Relations.png)\n","\n","The items in the domain set are the entities represented by a table. The mappings to the codomains are the attributes. While entities are by definition unique, we could map any given **domain entity** to **attribute values** in any number of codomains. Like the entities, the attribute values themselves are unique but the **attribute mappings** have no such constraint. We could map several entities to the same attribute value or even map an entity to itself (i.e., where codomain = domain) several times if we like. It is in this sense that **entities are unique** while **attribute mappings** are not.\n","\n","To determine if a given item is an entity, we look for **identifier attributes** that make sense in the story context. For example, does a bank need to track individual dollar bills (via serial numbers) or just the number of dollars in a person's account? If the former then dollars are entities. Otherwise, in the absence of a useful identifier, dollar amounts are just values used to describe something else (a customer's account, a financial transaction, etc.).\n","\n","> **Tip:** Identifier attributes should be immutable, never changing once they have been set. If one is ever tempted to modify an identifier then it is not really an identifier. So, for example, while we informally use people's names as identifiers, names can change and thus make poor identifiers. We are better off defining a new attribute (and id number, for example) and letting the name be just another non-key attribute. \n","\n","Besides the need for unique identifiers, there is another sense in which entities must be unique. **Each entity is always one thing and only one thing.** If an entity is composed of multiple things, then it is actually an **associative entity** that connects other things together. Each of these connected things is an entity, as is the association itself. \n","\n","Let's consider, for example, a marriage between two people. Is that one thing (a marriage) or three things (marriage plus two spouses)? In early versions of the database story it may be just a marriage license with a date, few signatures, and an id number. However, as the story gets fleshed out, one may find the need to represent the people getting married. While it is tempting to just add the details about these people to the marriage license itself, this makes the idea of a marriage license much more complex than it has to be. It also complicates questions like \"Has Toby been married before?\" or \"Is Toby *currently married* to somebody else?\" Instead of looking up Toby (and finding licenses), we would have to scan through licenses to find any with Toby's name. A much better, more savvy, way to do it is to **register each person** separately and then **reference** them on the marriage license. As long as the licenses are **indexed** by person $-$ easily done because each person has a unique identifier $-$ we could find any of Toby's previous marriages on file with one lookup.\n","\n","Once we have the entities worked out, the attributes are usually pretty easy to suss out. All we need to know in an ERD is what they are named, and whether any of them are identifiers (primary keys) or references (foreign keys). Data types and other constraints (e.g., allowed combinations of attribute values) can wait until logical design. \n","\n","\n","\n","\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"EXPGWJKoz1Gx"},"source":["---\n","## **Relationships**\n","Relationships are how the entities in our stories interact. They provide the action. How that action plays out depends on the natures of the entities and their interactions. \n","\n","Continuing our marriage example, here are three different scenarios, each as a different ERD:\n","\n","![Three Marriage Proposals](https://github.com/christopherhuntley/BUAN6510/raw/master/img/L6_Marriage_ERD.png)\n","\n","Scenario A represents the case where people are just names on a marriage license. Each person is listed as either `spouse1` or `spouse2`. This is a very static story with no action. It is almost as if nobody will ever read the story after it is written.\n","\n","Scenario B represents a person-centric case, where all that matters is who is currently married to whom. (It's a rare unary mapping of an entity domain onto itself.) Notice the phrasing of the text on the relationship. It describes the action (or more like a condition, depending on your views of marriage) of being married to another person. It is assumed that if person X is married to person Y that the relationship would be noted on both entities. If a person is unmarried, then the `spouseID` would be left blank.\n","\n","Scenario C separates out the marriage license from the people getting married. In this case we can add more attributes to the `Marriage License` and `Person` entities to indicate things like birthdates, divorce dates, etc. Generally, this is likely how your state records marriages. It is up to them to enforce the \"can't have more than one marriage at a time\" law. \n","\n","> Note that Scenario C allows for marriage to be between more than 2 people. Why? Because standard ERD graphic language doesn't distinguish between \"more than 1\" and \"many\". That marriage is between two people is a constraint that would be handled in the logical design phase of the database development."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"gvCX0aLbp8iS"},"source":["\n","### **Degrees**\n","\n","The degree of a relationship is how many entity types are being connected. \n","\n","By far the most common relationship is between two entity types. That is called a **binary relationship**, represented by scenario C in the marriage example. In the many-to-many relationship depicted, there can be just about any number of entities on either end. However, there are only two entity types involved. \n","\n","A **unary relationship** is one where the associations are among entities with the same entity type. A unary relationship was shown in scenario B. One can conceive of a unary relationship between rail cars on a train. Each car has 0 or 1 cars immediately before and 0 or cars after it. However, every rail car is a car. \n","\n","> We can have higher degree relationships (ternary, quaternary, etc.) as well. These are not very common and can be confusing to interpret. Often in such cases the designer will create an **associative entity** that represents the relationship itself. We only mention higher degree relationships in passing because you may see one in the wild someday.

(In fact, the counting numbers 1, 2, 3, etc. are sometimes called the cardinal numbers.) \n","\n","In database design the placement of foreign keys are determined by the maximum cardinalities of the relationships. In our ERD notation, there are three possibilities:\n","\n","![Maximum Cardinalities](https://github.com/christopherhuntley/BUAN6510/raw/master/img/L6_Max_Cardinalities.png)\n","\n","**In the one-to-one case, we will need foreign keys on or both ends of the relationship.** Given an entity on one side, we will need to be able to look up the entity on the other end. \n","\n","**In the one-to-many case we will always place the foreign key on the many end of the relationship.** If we were to put it on the one end then we would need to refer to a list of entities on the other end, which is not allowed by the relational model. (More specifically, it is not allowed by the 1NF rules.) Instead, we add a foreign key to the entity on the many end to indicate which one of the entities in the other type it is referring to. \n","\n","**In the many-to-many case we will eventually need to create an associative entity with foreign keys to the tables at either end.** This in effect converts the many-to-many relationship into two one-to-many relationships with a new entity type. In our ERDs that's fine, but in SQL we will need to create a new table for the cross-references. \n","\n","> The ERD diagrams shown here use \"crows foot\" notation with a triangular shape for \"many\" ends and a single cross hatch for the \"one\" ends. Other notations, including the original Chen models for the 1970s and the UML class diagrams used by software engineers, permit more specificity (\"maximum of 2\") but are a bit more verbose. Finally, as we shall see, there is no need for so much specificity when designing tables and columns.  \n","\n","### **Minimum Cardinalities**\n","\n","Minimum cardinalities indicate whether a relationship is optional or mandatory on each end. \n","\n","![Minimum Cardinalities](https://github.com/christopherhuntley/BUAN6510/raw/master/img/L6_Min_Cardinalities.png)\n","\n","The minimum cardinalities (either 0 or 1) are shown to the inside of the maximum cardinalities.

For entity A is it a little less strict, in that the B entity may already exist at the time we create entity A. However, if it doesn't then we are faced with creating two entities (an A and a B) at the same time. \n","- In the **mandatory-optional** case, mandatory entity A is the **parent** of the **child** entity B. To comply with the integrity rules, we just have to make sure that the parent precedes the child. If, however, the parent subsequently gets deleted, then the child either has to be deleted too or reassigned a new parent before deleting the current one. \n","- In the **optional-optional** case, both A and B can be considered strong because they do not have any required dependencies. \n","\n","> Note that it is possible to have twinning and parent-child relationships in many-to-many relationships. However, the terms used here would apply to the one-to-many relationships in the derived associate entity. \n","\n","Why do we care about this? Because it tells us in what order we need to load the database, with strong entities coming before their weaker dependents.
