We see this in database design most starkly. While the relational model defines domains and codomains, it does not address data types. ER diagrams can model concepts that can't actually be implemented in relational databases without a translation step. Even the rigorous laws of the normalization process come with plenty of exceptions to allow for special cases. We can define even more normal forms but at some point it just makes sense to get on with implementation. \n","\n","Now it is finally time to put all those details back in. There is a lot more to SQL than just `SELECT` queries!\n","\n","SQL is both a language and a platform. The language is a place for logical design. We create tables and define all the necessary rules to keep our data clean and informative. We then use yet more SQL to populate and maintain the tables. That's all built into the SQL language and is for the most part derived from the Relational Data Model. \n","\n","The SQL platform is 100% about implementation. Where does the data reside? How is it backed up? Who has access to the data and what are they allowed to do once they get there? These things are also supported in the SQL language, *even though they are technically not part of the Relational Database Model*. \n","\n","In this lesson we will cover SQL Data Definition Language (DDL) statements needed to implement a database design. But first, we will review some of the logical design details we didn't cover in module 3. \n"," "]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"NekcmKiCsxQm"},"source":["---\n","## **Logical Design Decisions**\n","\n","In this section we review a few logical design issues with SQL code implications.\n","\n","What's logical design again? Didn't we already cover that? \n","\n","Logical design is about making decisions that **may be difficult to undo afterwards.** Before we incur the technical debt $-$ note that debt here is not about money but having options $-$ we want to be very sure that we have the conceptual requirements correct. Logical design goes past that, finally spending the technical capital we have built up through our conceptual design work.\n","\n","### **Coding Conventions**\n","> There are only two hard things in Computer Science: cache invalidation and naming things. -- Phil Karlton\n","\n","In order to minimize typo bugs and reduce the mental burden for SQL users, it is important to always follow a consistent naming convention. It should be possible to *just know* if a query has a typo bug or a given column is likely to be spelled a certain way without having to read documentation. That's where conventions come into play. \n","\n","In the old days when most SQL coders were coming from COBOL or Fortran backgrounds, most developers followed naming conventions like:\n","- Table names in `ALL_CAPS`\n","- Column names in `Initial_Caps`\n","- Short but descriptive names for everything, like variables in another language\n","- All table and columns names in the singular form\n","\n","However, as the old languages died out, SQL coders began to ignore the old naming conventions in favor of a style more like what they were used to:\n","- Table names with `Initial_Caps` (or `no_caps_at_all`)\n","- Column names in `lower_case_letters`\n","- Longer table names, especially in big databases with *thousands* of tables\n","- Collective (plural) table names and scalar (singular) column names\n","\n","Names are important but not all of the story here. Coding *style* matters too. By being consistent and intentional, we can actually eliminate bugs! Some examples:\n","- Use uppercase for SQL keywords like `SELECT` or `AS`. This makes it clear what parts of a statement are syntax versus names of things. That way the next coder will know where to look for typos. \n","- Avoid long lines of text. Instead, break statements into logical chunks (e.g., clauses in a `SELECT` query), one line at a time. Use indentation to indicate that a statement continues onto the next line. \n","- When choosing data types, always prefer the standard ones over vendor-specific ones *unless* there is a major performance benefit and you don't mind being locked into a specific vendor's products forever.\n","\n","For what it's worth, there are [style guides](https://www.sqlstyle.guide/) that dictate many of these rules so we don't have to decide. Pick a set of rules and then be consistent.

For example, cross tables derived from associative entities (see *Converting ERDs to Relations* in Lesson 6) will often use a composite primary key composed of the table's *foreign keys*. That's a matter of preference, however. \n","- **Create indexes for selected non-key columns to allow fast lookups?** The advantage is speed but the storage costs for the indexes can be significant.

However, this practice affects readability of the code and, further, can cause seemingly nonsensical errors when a code forgets the trailing backtick on a name. It's an easy mistake; just typing a quote where you meant to have a backtick can cause lots of code immediately after the quote to become invisible to the SQL interpreter.

For forward compatibility, new databases should use the more the modern `INTEGER` data type instead. \n","\n","### **Column Constraints**\n","```sql \n","CREATE TABLE  tablename (\n","  column1 datatype1 constraint1,\n","  column2 datatype2 constraint2,\n","  ...\n",");\n","```\n","\n","Constraints generally come in four varieties:\n","- `NOT NULL`\n","- `UNIQUE`\n","- `DEFAULT` defaultvalue\n","- `AUTO_INCREMENT` (in MySQL, though other vendors use different names)\n","\n","It is possible to chain constraints one after another. `NOT NULL UNIQUE` happens to work the same as `PRIMARY KEY`. \n","\n","Once again, here is the `Batting` table from the baseball database.\n","```sql\n","CREATE TABLE `Batting` (\n","  `playerID` varchar(255) NOT NULL,\n","  `yearID` int(11) NOT NULL,\n","  `stint` int(11) DEFAULT 1,\n","  `teamID` varchar(255) NOT NULL,\n","  `lgID` varchar(255) DEFAULT NULL,\n","  `G` int(11) DEFAULT 0,\n","  `AB` int(11) DEFAULT 0,\n","  `R` int(11) DEFAULT 0,\n","  ...\n",");\n","```\n","\n","### **Indexes**\n","We can index a column with a special index constraint, usually located after all the column definitions. \n","\n","```sql \n","CREATE TABLE  tablename (\n","  column1 datatype1 constraint1,\n","  column2 datatype2 constraint2,\n","  column3 datatype3 constraint3,\n","  ...\n","  INDEX (column2,column3)\n",");\n","```\n"," \n","- The `INDEX` constraint can include any subset of the columns.

It's a relatively expensive but necessary operation. However, when we delete data from an indexed column, there is almost harm to just leaving the data in the index, skipping over it instead of deleting it. That avoids the cost of updating the index. \n","\n","We call this sort of thing a **soft delete**. A soft delete marks data for deletion at a later time, when it won't delay more important and timely operations. It is often quicker to delete lots of things at once than to delete them one at a time. \n","\n","At some point however, soft deletes can make our tables like an episode of *Hoarders*, with lots of leftover artifacts to navigate around. Everything then grinds to halt. \n","\n","Vacuuming is the process of rebuilding an index (or sometimes a whole table) to eliminate all the soft deletes. For a large database, this process may take a while. This is the kind of thing a database administrator will schedule for the middle of the night when it will affect the fewest users. \n","\n","Vacuuming out stale data is implemented in various ways, depending on the vendor. However, both PostreSQL and SQLite support a one line SQL command that handles all tables in the database.\n","\n","```sql\n","VACUUM;\n","```\n","\n","### **Metadata Queries**\n","One of the convenient features of SQL is that **databases contain their own metadata about themselves**. This allows a lot of this structural information to be accessed in SQL queries. \n","\n","Unfortunately, how to access the metadata varies from vendor to vendor. For example:\n","- In MySQL, information about tables, columns, etc. is kept in the `INFORMATION_SCHEMA` database. The user has to be granted permissions to it like any other database. Alternatively, if we want a list of tables in the current database, we can use the MySQL-specific `SHOW TABLES` and `DESCRIBE` statements. \n","- In SQLite, we can use the `pragma.table_info()` function within a `SELECT` statement to get information about the columns of a specific table. To get a list of all tables, we query the `sqlite_master` table.  \n","\n","### **Dump Files**\n","Databases systems are not like other software you may have encountered before. They are **always** reading and writing from/to storage. Thus, making a backup is not simply a matter of shutting down the DBMS and copying some files. That would both take the applications they support offline and possibly corrupt data. \n","\n","Instead, the DBMS provides a way to export the current state of the database to disk as a *dump file*. A dump file is a (possibly very very long) list of SQL statements that recreate the database. These files can then be archived like any other file. If needed the database can be loaded (or reloaded) from a dump file. \n","\n","Since dump files are written in SQL, this gives the database administrator the ability to rewrite the SQL when migrating the data from one SQL dialect to another. So, if Oracle does things differently from Microsoft SQL Server, then the SQL syntax, data types, etc. in the dump files are adjusted accordingly. \n","\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"DKpvT0vaTrwH"},"source":["---\n","## **Movies Tonight, Part 3**\n","\n","We continue the Movies Tonight case by converting the ERD and relations into SQLite DDL code.

However, analysts will find that they have to do this for themselves from time to time. \n","\n","The most common data text format for tabular data is CSV (comma separated values), which just about everything from Excel to Tableau, and even pandas can open with just a line or two. Unfortunately, SQL does not have native support for CSV files. Instead, each database vendor provided their own utilities, often included in a proprietary client app. None of that works in Colab, of course. \n","\n","Here we will consider two different ways to import CSV data from a file into a table. \n","\n","### **Import $\\rightarrow$ Dump $\\rightarrow$ Load**\n","While we can't run desktop software in Colab, we can run it locally on our own computers and then upload to our databases in the cloud.\n","\n","For what follows we will assume that you are using MySQL or SQLite. \n","\n","**Step 1. Fire up a database client app connected to a local *mirror* copy of the database.** \n","- In MySQL that means using [MySQL Workbench](https://www.mysql.com/products/workbench/) connected to a [MySQL server](https://www.mysql.com/products/standard/) running on your local computer. \n","- In SQLite that means using the `sqlite3` [command line app](https://sqlite.org/cli.html) or a third-party package like [Sequel Pro](https://www.sequelpro.com/).\n","\n","**Step 2. Import the data.** \n","- MySQL Workbench has a function just for this purpose. \n","- In `sqlite3` we will need to set the mode to `csv` and then import the file. \n","In both cases, a new table can be created if needed. Otherwise, data will be appended to an existing table. \n","\n","**Step 3. Export the data to a dump file.**\n","- MySQL has a command line utility called `mysqldump` for this. Or, we can use the export features of the MySQL Workbench app. \n","- In SQLite, we can just copy the database file itself. (We did this in Lesson 1, by the way.)\n","\n","**Step 4. Load the dump file to somewhere Colab can find it.**\n","- For MySQL, upload the file to our cloud workspace (e.g., Google Drive). Then run the dump file by either i) copying the code into a cell or ii) using pandas (see below).\n","- For SQLite, all we need to do is open a database connection. It's already loaded. \n","\n","**Please consider the Import $\\rightarrow$ Dump $\\rightarrow$ Load technique as a last resort. There are so many ways it could go wrong. The second technique is much easier, but you will need to know a few lines of Python first.** \n","\n","### **Using pandas**\n","The pandas package knows all about CSV files. It can also connect to SQL databases. It's all in the [pandas IO docs](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/user_guide/io.html).\n","\n","The process then is exactly the same, regardless of the database vendor. The pandas package takes care of it all for us. \n","\n","**Step 1. Use `pd.read_csv()` to import the data into a `DataFrame`.** You may need to read through the [`pd.read_csv()` documentation](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/user_guide/io.html#io-read-csv-table) to get the data types and other details right. \n","\n","**Step 2. Use the `DataFrame.to_sql()` method to import the data to your database.**\n","As with  `pd.read_csv()`, it might help to read the [`DataFrame.to_sql()` documenation](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/user_guide/io.html#io-sql). \n","\n","\n","**We will see exactly this technique used for the Movies Tonight data in Lesson 8.**\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"f65_eey7BvoV"},"source":["---\n","## **SQL AND BEYOND: SQLAlchemy and Object Relational Mapping**\n","\n","If we dig into the innards of `%%sql` magic we find that it is mostly a *wrapper* for [SQLAlchemy](https://www.sqlalchemy.org/), a Python library that does all the heavy lifting of connecting to databases, sending SQL requests, and formatting SQL responses. \n","\n","For example, the following Python code connects to our MoviesTonight database and displays metadata for the tables found inside.\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n"," \n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","  \n","\n"," \n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n"]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"pPWwFJgYbYHG","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1612815850943,"user_tz":300,"elapsed":546,"user":{"displayName":"Christopher Huntley","photoUrl":"","userId":"11069151036176747256"}},"outputId":"6d5cbaaf-ade2-475e-e9cf-e775a70b9243"},"source":["from sqlalchemy import create_engine\n","engine = create_engine('sqlite:///buan6510/data/MoviesTonight/MoviesTonight.db')\n","\n","with engine.connect() as conn:\n","  resultset = conn.execute(\"SELECT * FROM sqlite_master\") \n","  for row in resultset:\n","    print(row)"],"execution_count":39,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","text":["('table', 'theaters', 'theaters', 2, 'CREATE TABLE theaters(\\n  theaterID INTEGER PRIMARY KEY, -- SQLites uses this syntax for surrogate keys\\n  name TEXT NOT NULL,             -- SQLite uses TEXT datatype for all text\\n  location TEXT NOT NULL,\\n  phone TEXT\\n)')\n","('table', 'movies', 'movies', 3, 'CREATE TABLE movies (\\n  movieID INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,  \\n  title TEXT NOT NULL,             \\n  rating TEXT\\n)')\n","('table', 'artists', 'artists', 4, 'CREATE TABLE artists (\\n    artistID INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,\\n    name TEXT NOT NULL,\\n    bio TEXT                       -- Included for future use\\n)')\n","('table', 'shows', 'shows', 5, 'CREATE TABLE shows (\\n    showID INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,\\n    showtime TEXT NOT NULL,        -- We may revisit the data type later\\n    movieID INTEGER  ...

These objects are defined in similar fashion to relational entities but can include functionality (methods) as well as data.
