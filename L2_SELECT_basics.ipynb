Consider, for example, the January 2021 *Tiobe Index* of popular programming languages, where SQL is listed as #12. Every other language on the list can be used to build apps and systems. We call them general purpose languages. SQL, however, is explicitly a special purpose language, designed for data management and only data management. Of the others on the list the most similar in that respect is R. Though it is certainly possible to create apps in R, the focus is on data analysis and only data analysis. Everything else is strictly general purpose.  So, if SQL is so out of step with the rest of the programming language universe, why is it considered a critical data analytics skill? Because it does its job extremely well, of course, but there is more to it than that. \n","\n","![Tiobe Index](https://github.com/christopherhuntley/BUAN6510/raw/master/img/L2_tiobe_index.png)\n","\n","SQL is an ancient programming language. Of the others on the list, the only one that could be considered a contemporary is C. (Assembly Language is technically not a single language but a kind of language, so it does not have an age *per se*.) Both C and SQL were developed in the late 1960s and released in the early 1970s. The others came along *decades* later. By then C and SQL were already ubiquitous, in use by millions of programmers around the world. \n","\n","Age and \"first mover advantage\" are not all of the SQL story though. Recall the three tiered model from Lesson 1? Each of the tiers are treated by the others as a black box, with internal implementation details hidden behind a *public interface* (often called an API). As long as a given tier can handle certain requests, phrased in such and such a way and producing results in specified format, then nobody has to care *how* it works. That is extremely powerful! SQL just happens to provide just such an interface. For basic CRUD operations in the data tier, SQL provides a complete and standard set of requests and responses that any application or system can rely on. Further, if a better implementation of the standards embodied by SQL comes along, we can upgrade to the newer technology without modifying *any* existing code. \n","\n","So, when asked \"Why SQL?\" the best answer is \"Why not SQL?\" because that is the right way to think of it. SQL works so well for many, many applications supported by millions of programmers. Thus, the burden of proof for an application programmer to disqualify SQL is to show that SQL can't get the job done and then propose something that does. Even then, the smart boss will instinctively ask for the same data integrity protections provided by SQL. In the end, using anything else is like swimming upstream, where relatively gentle currents on a clear day can become deadly in a storm. In other words, never assume that what works for local storage on an isolated iPhone will work for the cloud servers it connects with. The volume of data and the likelihood of corruption is just too high. Some companies, usually startups, that made the wrong choice are having to live with their decisions and ... scaling up to SQL compliance. Why not start there from the beginning? \n","\n","\n"," \n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"AHZRZ45sMUBw"},"source":["## **SQL History, Standards, and Use Cases**\n","\n","Structured Query Language (SQL) was developed by researchers at IBM in the early 1970s. The original name was Sequel, which is how many of us pronounce SQL to this very day. Unlike human language, programming languages have version numbers that track the evolution of the language over time. For many years, SQL was whatever IBM defined it to be, but by the mid-1980s it was an established standard endorsed by American National Standards Institute (as SQL-86). There have been newer versions over the many years since (most recently as SQL:2019) that extend the original SQL standards to include things like XML data, binary large objects (BLOBs), and window functions. We will come back to these newer features in the latter portions of this course.  \n","\n","SQL is not a full-featured language like C, C#, Java, Python, etc. Instead, it is considered a *data sublanguage* for creating and processing *relational* data and metadata. As discussed for this purpose it is ubiquitous, with support by just any programming language on earth. \n","\n","While we think of SQL as a language, the SQL *standard* defines five different kinds of language, each of which represents a different *use case*:\n","- Data Definition Language (DDL)\n","- Data Manipulation Language (DML)\n","- SQL/Persistent Stored Modules (SQL/PSM)\n","- Transaction Control Language (TCL)\n","- Data Control Language (DCL)\n","\n","We are going to focus on DML and DDL statements. The rest are mostly for SQL DB Administrators/Engineers. However, it is good to know what they are when the engineers bring them up in a meeting. \n","\n","The difference between data definition and data manipulation lies in what kinds of data are being addressed. DDL is used to create, describe, modify, or discard *metadata*: \n","- Tables, columns, etc. \n","- Relationships, keys, etc. \n","\n","DML is used to retrieve, add, update, or delete *data*:\n","- SELECT statements retrieve data from tables\n","- INSERT, UPDATE, and DELETE statements manage the data in the tables\n","\n","In addition to DDL and DML, we will also consider a few relevant SQL/PSM, TCL, and DCL statements but always with an eye toward how they interact with DDL and DML.

Most names are provided by the coder when they create the database tables. However, sometimes these names are not specific enough, and SQL must generate names without our help. Usually the generated names are not exactly the most human friendly (unless you happen to be Elon Musk). In such cases we define *aliases*, which act as nicknames for whatever the given name is. \n","\n","We've used column aliases a couple times already. \n","\n","```SELECT nameLast, count(*) AS cnt```\n","\n","\n","Why would we want to use an alias? Here are a few common use cases:\n","\n","- **To make queries shorter and less subject to typo bugs.** Given the sometimes long and abstruse variable names found in some data sets, it only makes sense to use names that coders can actually type.\n","- **To give a function call or other calculation a meaningful name.** Column names like `1+1` just don't make much sense, so we provide aliases to use instead.  \n","- **To disambiguate duplicate column names.** This sort of thing happens when querying from multiple tables that use the same column names. \n","- **To make certain kinds of advanced queries possible.** For example, there are times when a table might be *joined with itself*, which happens more often than one would expect. \n","\n","We'll see each of these soon enough. Now let's see where they appear in code.\n","\n","### **Naming Conventions, Backticks, and Dot Notation**\n","\n","SQL standards *recommend* the same naming conventions as any other mainstream programming language: \n","- use short but descriptive names like `birthdate` or `weight`\n","- no spaces or other punctuation except possibly underscores between compound names like `first_name` or `birth_weight`\n","- no names that match SQL keywords or function names like `SELECT`, `FROM`, `AS`, `count(*)`, etc. \n","- no duplicate names in the same table or resultset. \n","\n","However, SQL does not *enforce* any of these rules directly by flagging an invalid name. Instead, it will complain and possibly throw an obscure error that says nothing about the name being invalid. \n","\n","To make the errors go away there is an easy but awkward workaround. If a name would otherwise be invalid, then we can wrap it in **backticks** like this: \\`name\\`. The backtick character is found just above the `tab` key on most keyboards. (Why backticks instead of quotes? So that column names can have quote characters in them.) So for example, if we *just had* to have a table column named `1+1` then we can just refer to it as \\``1+1`\\` wherever it is needed. Without the backticks, SQL would just run the calculation and (possibly) complain that a column name was not specified. \n","\n","Similarly, since we can construct new tables by combining several existing tables, it sometimes occurs that we end up with duplicate column names. In that case we can disambiguate the column name using **dot notation**:\n","\n","```table.column```\n","\n","If two tables `A` and `B` have the column `date`, then we can refer to the columns as `A.date` and `B.date`.  \n","\n","In certain rare cases we may even be working with tables from multiple databases. We can do that by prepending the database name:  \n","\n","```database.table.column```\n","\n","Keep this in mind the next time you need to copy data from one database to another. \n","\n","### **Column Aliases**\n","\n","The format of a column alias is \n","\n","``` column AS alias```\n","\n","This is the simplest and most common kind of alias. \n","\n","### **Expression Aliases** \n","\n","A calculation like `1+1` is an *expression*. Expressions are bits of code that can be evaluated to produce a value. If the expression is complex we might enclose it in parentheses and then give it a alias:\n","\n","```( expression ) AS alias```  \n","\n","That makes the scope of the expression as clear as possible and gets around the silly name problems they can cause.\n","\n","### **Table Aliases**\n","\n","The format of a table alias is the same as for a column alias. The difference is that they are found in the `FROM` clause instead of the `SELECT` clause. We can then use the table alias anywhere we need to refer to the table. \n","\n","```sql\n","SELECT a.column1, a.column2, b.column1\n","FROM atablewithanimpossiblylongname AS a \n","      JOIN anothertablewithalongname AS b USING (ID)\n","WHERE a.column1 > b.column1;\n","```\n","\n","We can, also, of course, use column aliases to disambiguate the two columns called `column1`. \n","\n","### **Views (Query Aliases)**\n","\n","We can give queries names so we can reuse them later. We call these recallable queries *views*. The syntax to create a view is: \n","\n","```sql\n","CREATE VIEW view-name AS \n","SELECT ...\n","```\n","\n","Notice that this time the alias (shown above as `view-name`) comes *before* the `AS`. This allows the query to be as long as needed without affecting readability. If the query is *really* long then we may treat it like another other long expression and enclose it in parentheses when creating the view. \n","\n","Once a view has been created we can use it just like a table! There are some times when that is the best way to break apart complex queries into smaller ones that are easier to debug.  \n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"Dh1jOByKozYz"},"source":["---\n","## **Boolean Expressions**\n","\n","A boolean expression is anything that can be tested and found True or False. Boolean expressions are typically used as conditions to test in `WHERE` or `HAVING` clauses but there are other uses as well. \n","\n","In the examples, below each kind of boolean expression involves an **operator** that defines the True / False test. The general pattern is always:\n","\n","`LE operator RE`\n","\n","where left expression (LE) and right expression (RE) are anything that SQL can *evaluate* to determine values. The simplest example is something like\n","\n","```1 > 2```\n","\n","which evaluates to True. A more complicated example is\n","\n","```10*3+(9-4)*8 = item_number```\n","\n","where the left expression `10*3+(9-4)*8` is a calculation and the right expression `item_number` is a column. \n","\n","**Heads up:** True and False as used throughout this course are actually the numbers 1 (True) and 0 (False).

Most languages (like the 14 others on the TIOBE Index at the top of this less) do that with if statements: **if such and such is true then do this.** SQL, however, is different from all of those other languages because **`SELECT` statements specify the results instead of the step-by-step procedural logic to generate the results.** In other words, there is no way to say **then do this procedure** in SQL.

Once one is found to be true then the CASE statement ends immediately without trying the remaining conditions. If none of the conditions are met then the `ELSE` clause (if it exists) is executed; otherwise the `CASE` expression terminates with an error. \n","\n","If each of the conditions are just alternate possible values of the same expression then we can use a slightly more compact form:\n","\n","```sql\n","CASE expression\n","  WHEN value1 THEN expression1\n","  WHEN value2 THEN expression2\n","  ...\n","  ELSE expressionN\n","END\n","```\n","\n","where `value1`, `value2`, ... represent the possible values.

If they also have individual column names, then add a `GROUP BY` clause that includes each column name not in a function call.**"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"www2vN5LTlDo"},"source":["---\n","## **PRO TIPS: How to use SQL in Python and Excel**\n","### **SQL in Python (and Pandas)**\n","As discussed in Lesson 1, support for SQL (and SQLite) is built into Python. The [PEP 249](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0249/) documentation provides all the nitty gritty details. However, for our purposes, where we just want to extract data from a relational database, there are simpler ways to do it that involve less code and risk of creating bugs.\n","\n","We will assume that the final destination for the data is a [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/) DataFrame. The pandas library (package) was among the things we imported at the beginning of this lesson. The code looked like this:\n","```python \n","import pandas as pd\n","```\n","Pretty simple, right? The syntax even looks sort of SQL like, using `as` to specify the alias `pd` for the library name. (That actually happens a lot, with newer languages cribbing off of C and SQL for things like this.)\n","\n","When using Jupyter the easiest way to extract data from a SQL database in a is just like we've been doing it. Use `%sql` magic and then use the results in a Python code cell. For short snippets of SQL we can do something like this:\n","\n","\n","

use pandas's built in SQL support instead. Once the data is imported as  DataFrames, one can then use pandas functions and methods to do the sorts of things SQL does (sorting, grouping, counting, joining, etc.) but in a Pythonic way. After we get a better handle on SQL we will return to pandas to see how some of these things are done, but for now we are just concerned about retrieving data from a SQL database. If you are curious how this works then refer to the [pandas IO Tools docs](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/user_guide/io.html), where you will find the `read_sql()` function and its cousins `read_sql_table()` and `read_sql_query()`.

It is, after Oracle, the second most popular DBMS as of January 2021, according to [DB-engines.com](https://db-engines.com/en/ranking).\n","\n","![MySQL ranking](https://github.com/christopherhuntley/BUAN6510/raw/master/img/L2_db_engines_popularity.png)\n","\n","Like SQLite, which we introduced in Lesson 1, MySQL has very modest origins. It was started in 1994 as free software under the GNU General Public License and found its first widespread usage as the \"backend\" of some of the earliest e-commerce websites. By 1996 it was the most deployed DBMS on the web. There were two primary reasons for this popularity:\n","- It was \"free as in beer\" (no cost) and free as in freedom (to debug and adapt as needed).\n","- It had \"lightning fast\" read performance on super cheap hardware. \n","\n","However, these obvious advantages came at a cost:\n","- It had \"slow as molasses\" write performance.\n","- It did not enforce referential integrity rules.\n","- It did not have transaction controls (rollback on error).\n","\n","So, it could take a while to record a sale and even then it might corrupt the data if a query was badly written or the server lost power. That's what we lived with back then, when the choice was either i) pay a fortune for Oracle or Microsoft; or ii) take your chances with MySQL and make frequent backups. \n","\n","Over the years, MySQL has remained free and highly efficient, still a default choice for millions of websites. Meanwhile, it has also become standards compliant, often implementing all the required features of the latest standard *before* competing DBMS products. Finally, in 2008 it was acquired by Sun Microsystems and then by Oracle in 2010. So, for those keeping track, Oracle actually owns the top two DBMS products on the market. (And it sells paid support for MySQL for those who need it.)\n","\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"qVL7n_Rys_95"},"source":["## **Congratulations!
