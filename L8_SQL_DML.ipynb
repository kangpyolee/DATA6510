In past lessons we discussed the four basic CRUD actions in the abstract. Now we will get into the nitty gritty details, or at least the ones that can be addressed with SQL.\n","\n","In principle we'd like the data in our database to survive IT armageddon where the power shuts down with no notice, the database is in the middle of a lengthy operation, and the consequences of failure are catastrophic. Then perhaps we can begin to count on it being there when we need it. \n","\n","The gold standard for robustness in the face of catastrophic failure is ACID, four properties that together go as far as possible to keep our data safe:\n","- **Atomicity.** Lengthy transactions with lots of steps are treated as one unit. If any step fails then we can roll it back to the beginning, as if it never happened. \n","- **Consistency.** We never want the database to be in an unexpected or unrecoverable state. If given data operations in any given order the result is always the same. There is no ambiguity or uncertainty introduced by the system itself. \n","- **Isolation.** Just like people, databases often have to multitask, processing several transactions at once. Ideally, we want to keep failure of any transaction from causing failure of another. They should be running as independently as possible, *especially* when failure risk is high. \n","- **Durability.** Once data has been committed by a transaction, it should persist until another transaction alters it. \n","\n","If you think about each of these things, you will realize just how fragile most software really is. \n","- How far back in time does the \"undo\" on your word processor allow you to go back? If everything you have written since yesterday afternoon was garbage, could you recover it *even if you never saved it anywhere?* \n","- If your computer crashed while it was halfway through saving the latest draft of your senior thesis, would the file be recoverable? Would you lose half your work?\n","- If you and a classmate are editing the same Google doc and your partner falls asleep at the keyboard, typing an infinite string of J characters ..., can you regain control before everything is destroyed? Or do you have to start over with a new doc? \n","- If you start recording a workout on your smart watch but then forget to end the workout before all of the power is drained from your battery, does any data get lost? \n","\n","ACID is how we prevent all of these things from blowing up your data. \n","\n","Okay, so where do you get ACID? From any modern relational database product. Even the most primitive ones like SQLite or MS Access are better than any other tool for keeping your data safe. They are CRUD on ACID, and that's a good thing. \n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"NekcmKiCsxQm"},"source":["---\n","## **ETL = Extract $\\rightarrow$ Transform $\\rightarrow$ Load**\n","\n","While it is certainly wonderful and makes the analyst's life much easier if data was collected expressly for their use, the typical case is not so great. Data can come from anywhere and may require significant scrubbing before it can be trusted. In some cases, there may be multiple data sources, with somewhat incompatible data to be merged into a coherent dataset. \n","\n","The general process of working with such *dirty* data is called ETL:\n","- **Extract** data from the original sources.\n","- **Transform** and integrate it to fit the new purpose.\n","- **Load it** into a central data repository that will protect the data from corruption.\n","\n","While there are certainly other tools for this purpose, SQL is a great place to start:\n","- Modern relational databases include utilities for working with data in various formats. \n","- SQL includes plenty of functions for transforming data from one data type to another *plus* the power of SQL queries to bring it all together into a useful form. **If SQL is not not enough, then use another tool as well.** SQL is already compatible with just about every programming language on earth. It has serious first mover advantage from decades of heavy use.\n","- When you are done, the data can reside safely in a database with the guarantees of full ACID compliance. \n","\n","After reviewing the syntax and function of SQL `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, and `DELETE` statements, we will consider a few special cases that put ACID principles to the test.  \n","\n"," \n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"Wz-90R2ZFVAz"},"source":["---\n","## **SQL `INSERT` Statements** \n","We use `INSERT` statements to add rows to a table. There are two basic forms:\n","- Adding new data (values) to the database\n","- Addind table data extracted (selected) from another table\n","\n","### **`INSERT INTO ... VALUES`**\n","\n","```sql\n","INSERT INTO tablename ( columnlist ) VALUES\n","  ( valuelist ); \n","```\n","\n","- `columnlist` and `valuelist` are comma-separated lists of column names and literal values. The two lists have exactly the same number of items, with the first column corresponding to the first value, etc.\n","- Any columns not included in the `columnlist` are not assigned a NULL value unless a `DEFAULT` value is specified.\n","- If the table has a surrogate primary key, then generally we do not want to include the primary key column; the database will generate it for us.\n","- When we say *literal values* in the `valuelist` we mean the values they would appear in a `WHERE` clause. It would be the value to the right of the `=` in a boolean expression. \n","- The parentheses and trailing semicolon are not optional. \n","\n","We can insert multiple rows at a time as follows. \n","\n","```sql\n","INSERT INTO tablename ( columnlist ) VALUES\n","  ( valuelist1 ),\n","  ( valuelist2 ), \n","  ...\n","  ;\n","```\n","\n","- That's a list of `valuelist` items, one per row.\n","- There is no comma just before the semicolon.\n","\n","For example, the following adds two new movies to the Movies Tonight database:\n","```sql\n","INSERT INTO movies ( title, rating ) VALUES \n","  ('Romeo and Juliet', 'PG-13'),\n","  ('A Time to Kill','PG-13');\n","```\n","Note that the `movieID` column was omitted because it is autogenerated by the database. \n","\n","\n","### `INSERT INTO ... SELECT`\n","If the data is already in the database in some form, then we can use a `SELECT` query to  gather the data values prior to insertion.\n","\n","```sql\n","INSERT INTO tablename ( columnlist ) \n","  SELECT ...\n","  ;\n","```\n","\n","- As with inserting literal values the columns returned by the `SELECT` query must correspond to the ones in the `columnlist`\n","- The actual names of the columns returned by the `SELECT` query do not matter, though the data types should be compatible with what is already defined in the table. \n","\n","Another movies example, this time using data [imported from IMDB](https://www.imdb.com/interfaces/):\n","\n","```sql\n","INSERT INTO movies ( title )  \n","  SELECT primaryTitle \n","  FROM imdb_title_basics_import \n","  WHERE startYear = \"1996\" \n","```\n","\n","- Since IMDB does not provide US movie ratings in its public data dumps the `ratings` column was omitted from the `columnlist`. That also means that the `ratings` column has to allow null values. Otherwise the insertion will fail. \n","- If we want to keep track of the `tconst` movie identifier used by IMDB then we will have to add another column to the `movies` table. \n","\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"FDWxUbP_K0cj"},"source":["---\n","## **SQL `UPDATE` Statements**\n","\n","SQL `UPDATE` statements set specific column values on selected rows. \n","\n","```sql\n","UPDATE tablename \n","SET\n","  column1 = newvalue1,\n","  column2 = newvalue2,\n","  ...\n","WHERE ...\n",";\n","```\n","- Only the columns that are being updated need to be included.\n","- The `WHERE` clause works just like in a `SELECT` query.\n","- A new value can be any expression that returns a scalar value. That includes subqueries. \n","- It is possible to use joins to update several tables at once. However, that is fairly new to the SQL standards and not likely to work in older (legacy) databases. It won't work n MySQL 5.7, for example, but it does work in MySQL 8.0. The workaround is to use subqueries (with joins) instead. \n","\n","Here we are updating the *Romeo + Juliet* movie title to its proper name.\n","\n","```sql \n","UPDATE movies \n","SET\n","  title = 'Romeo + Juliet' \n","WHERE\n","  movieID = 24;\n","```"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"EDSvJAd3atPB"},"source":["---\n","## **SQL `DELETE` Statements**\n","\n","Deleting rows is about as easy as it gets. \n","\n","```sql\n","DELETE FROM tablename\n","WHERE ...\n","```\n","\n","- There is no need to specify columns.\n","- If the `WHERE` clause is omitted then *every* row is deleted. \n","- We can delete from multiple tables at a time with slightly altered syntax.

The DBMS is always on the lookout for integrity violations. Each query is treated as an *atomic transaction* that can be undone (rolled back) if it does not complete sucessfully. Thus, is an update query sets a foreign key to an impossible value or nullified something that can't be null, then the database will immediately complain and return the database state to whatever it was before the query. \n","\n","While that is a very reasonable and safe way to approach data integrity, it has some implciations for how and when we load data into a given table. We will first consider cases where **table load order** can be used to avoid referential integrity violations. Then we will consider cases where we have to go further, using custom transaction controls to force the database to do what we need it to. \n","\n","### **Strongest First Loading**\n","The vast majority of referential integrity problems can be prevented by taking care about the order in which we insert and delete records. \n","\n","Consider any parent-child relationship where the parent must exist before the child. \n","\n","The process to add a new child row is then:\n","1. If the parent doesn't exist then add the parent first.\n","2. Once the parent exists, then add the child. \n","\n","Deleting the parent can cause the opposite problem, as all children will need to be deleted before the parent. We can use `ON DELETE CASCADE` in the foreign key constraints to handle that automatically.\n","\n","When applied to a whole database the load order is strongest to weakest:\n","1. Load all the strong entities.\n","2. Load all weak entities that only depend on strng entities.\n","3. Load any entities that only rely on #1 and #2.\n","4. ...\n","\n","We will see this strategy in place with the Movies Tonight case a little further down. \n","\n","### **Transaction Control**\n","\n","Sometimes just taking care with load order is not enough. For those cases we use transaction control. \n","\n","Consider the classic parent-child-grandchild case, where there is a whole hierarchy of entities to be saved at once. This might happen, for example, when saving a new customer, the customer's order invoice, and the invoice line items. Based on the Strongest to Weakest rule, we would save the parent (customer record), then the child (invoice), and then the grand children (line items). \n","\n","The SQL code might look something like this:\n","\n","```sql\n","INSERT INTO customers ...\n","INSERT INTO invoices ...  -- MySQL: use LAST_INSERT_ID() function to get the new customer id \n","                          -- SQLite: use LAST_INSERT_ROWID()\n","INSERT INTO invoice_items ...\n","```\n","\n","However, what happens if there is a problem saving one of the grand children? Then the entire transaction should be voided, including the invoice and new customer record. Instead of deleting them one by one, we can use a transaction block instead:\n","\n","```sql\n"," \n","BEGIN;        -- Start a new Transaction\n","INSERT INTO customers ...  \n","INSERT INTO invoices ...\n","INSERT INTO invoice_items ...\n","COMMIT;       -- Finalize the Transaction\n","```\n","\n","If the transaction fails before the `COMMIT` statement, then all changes made during the transaction are ignored. It's like it never happened. \n","\n","Generally, multistep transactions like this are packaged together as **stored procedures**. However, since creating stored procedures is more of a task for data engineers than data analysts, it is beyond the scope of this course. \n","\n","#### **Solving the Twinning Problem**\n","Transaction control can be used to solve the mandatory twins issue from Lesson 6. Depending on the database vendor, there are two different approaches. \n","\n","The most common (and theoretically correct) approach is **deferred commit**, where specific foreign key checks are marked as *deferrable* if they are inside of a transaction block. The keys are then checked as part of the `COMMIT` at the end. [This is how it works in SQLite](https://www.sqlite.org/foreignkeys.html), for example. \n","\n","A more risky approach is to **explictly disable foreign key checks** during a given transaction block. In MySQL this looks like:\n","\n","```sql \n","BEGIN;\n","SET foreign_key_checks = 0; -- disables FK checking\n","...\n","SET foreign_key_checks = 1; -- reenables FK checking\n","COMMIT;\n","```\n","\n","The risk here is that one might forget to the `SET foreign_key_checks = 1;` step just before the `COMMIT`.

Try to follow along but know that you will not be quizzed on it.**\n","\n","Sometimes the source data will be formatted in a way that is not compatible with your database design. While the correct answer is usually to handle it before loading into the database $-$ Python and pandas are designed just for this sort of thing $-$ we can handle some of this using SQL itself. \n","\n","We saw an example in the Movies Tonight case, where we had to use a `CASE` expression to translate nonstandard show times to work in SQLite, which does not have native support for DATETIME data. From the docs:\n","> SQLite has no DATETIME datatype. Instead, dates and times can be stored in any of these ways:\n",">- As a TEXT string in the ISO-8601 format. Example: '2018-04-02 12:13:46'.\n",">- As an INTEGER number of seconds since 1970 (also known as \"unix time\").\n",">- As a REAL value that is the fractional Julian day number.\n",">\n",">The [built-in date and time functions](https://sqlite.org/lang_datefunc.html) of SQLite understand date/times in all of the formats above, and can freely change between them. Which format you use, is entirely up to your application.\n","\n","We have time string data in TEXT format. However, our time strings are not in ISO-8601 format, which uses 24-hour military times instead of AM and PM. Thus, the time '2:00 PM' should be '14:00' in ISO format. Unfortunately, SQLite does not provide a built in function to do the conversion, so we will need to handle the translation ourselves using `CASE` expressions. \n","\n","The following shows the process used to develop the `CASE` expression for Movies Tonight. \n","\n","**Pass 1: Detecting AM/PM**  \n","Let's start with recognizing that 'AM' has different rules from 'PM':\n","- We will be converting the `ShowTime` column from the `DATASET` table. \n","- The `upper()` function converts everything to uppercase.

Service**\n","\n","As you work with larger and larger datasets, your needs will eventually outgrow what will fit in SQLite or perhaps even your laptop's drive. For that you will want to use one of the budget-priced cloud storage services. We explored Google Cloud Platform in Lesson 3. It's great for one table databases but sometimes you are going to want the full relational model. Now it's Amazon's turn. \n","\n","Launched in 2009, Amazon's RDS service is a very popular choice for cloud-based RDBMS hosting, used for everything from the biggest enterprise systems to the smallest hobby projects. It supports a variety of relational DBMS platforms (Oracle, SQL Server, PostgreSQL, MySQL, MariaDB, etc.), with automated handling of system backups, user access controls, data migration, etc. that would normally require a trained database administrator. It also has virtually unlimited scale, pricing out storage capacity and data access bandwidth at commodity prices. \n","\n","Here we will walk through a managed MySQL server instance in RDS's Free Tier, which is plenty capable for most analytical projects.

It is easy to import and export in/out of a spreadsheet, the files are fairly compact, and everybody has seen them before. However, there are some drawbacks for relational data:\n","- A CSV file can only contain one table \n","- Data types have to be inferred (and software will sometimes get it wrong)\n","- It has no support for keys of any sort\n","- Not very convenient for binary data (BLOBs)\n","\n","In order to make CSV files work properly for loading data into a relational database, the tried and true method is to \n","- Create the table schema first (with `CREATE TABLE`).\n","- Import data into the database from csv file. This will create one or more tables that we will drop at the end. They are only needed to get the data into the database. \n","- Use SQL DML (`INSERT` and `UPDATE`) to populate the tables in the schema. The DML would be executed, one table at a time, following the \"strongest entity first\" rule to avoid referential integrity violations. However, if you are 100% sure there will be no violations, then it is recommended to temporarily turn off [referential integrity checks when bulk-loading data](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/optimizing-innodb-bulk-data-loading.html).\n","\n","![Bulk Load Performance](https://github.com/christopherhuntley/BUAN6510/raw/master/img/L8_fk_check_off.png)\n","\n","We'll take these one step at a time, with a load of a full season of NBA PlayLog data.\n","\n","**1. Create Table Schema.**\n","The first step is exactly like we have done before:\n","![Create Table Schema](https://github.com/christopherhuntley/BUAN6510/raw/master/img/L8_Create_Table_Schema.png)\n","\n","Note that the `DROP TABLE` statements are in the reverse order of the `CREATE TABLE` statements. That's once again to avoid referential integrity violations.  \n","\n","> **Heads up**: This method of keeping the DDL separate from the data files has an added advantage. It allows us to migrate data from one DBMS to another, even when they have different SQL dialects. The CSV files (or `INSERT` statements) would be the same for any vendor. We just have to change the data types and other details in the DDL to fit the SQL dialect we are migrating to. \n","\n","**2. Load from CSV files.**\n","The source data can be loaded into the database any number of ways. MySQL, for example has a `LOAD DATA` command that can [pull directly from a CSV file](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/load-data.html). In the example below, pandas is used to load the data in a somewhat DBMS-agnostic way:\n","\n","![pandas data load](https://github.com/christopherhuntley/BUAN6510/raw/master/img/L8_Load_From_Pandas.png)\n","\n","The data is loaded one year at a time, with one CSV file per database table (`teams_import`, `games_import`, etc.).\n","\n","> **Heads up:** We can also load the data from one huge CSV file (e.g., the `PlayLog` table we have already explored) and then parse it out to several normalized tables. However, there are performance issues that can lock up the server if the CSV file is big enough. That is actually the case here. It's faster and less problematic to do some work before uploading to the server. \n","\n","**3. DML to Populate Tables.**\n","With the data already in the database, we can then use `INSERT INTO ... SELECT` statements to transfer the data to tables. The query below loads data into the `games` table. Notice that it requires a pair of joins to the `teams` table in order to look up `team_id` keys.  \n","\n","![DML Populate Tables](https://github.com/christopherhuntley/BUAN6510/raw/master/img/L8_DML_Populate_Tables.png)\n","\n","Each of these `INSERT` statements is a database transaction **which can fail** for any of a number of reasons:\n","- Primary key or foreign key violation. \n","- Uses up 100% of CPU, memory, or disk space.\n","\n","![CPU Utlization](https://github.com/christopherhuntley/BUAN6510/raw/master/img/L8_CPU_Utlization.png)\n","\n","- Connection reset due to a timeout. \n","\n","![Connection Reset](https://github.com/christopherhuntley/BUAN6510/raw/master/img/L8_MySQL_Connection_Reset.png)\n","\n","- ... so many more ...\n","\n","Behind the scenes, the DBMS is going to great lengths to monitor each tansaction to warn if things are going awry. The key stat below is the \"undo log entries,\" which shows that 4.5 million rows of data would have to be rolled back if the query were to fail. \n","\n","![Transaction Monitoring](https://github.com/christopherhuntley/BUAN6510/raw/master/img/L8_MySQL_Transaction_Monitoring.png)\n","\n","Average write performance was about 1500 rows per second. If that drops to 0, then the database may be in a deadlocked state. Breaking the deadlock requires rebooting the server and yes, there is some risk that the server won't reboot. That's what backups are for! \n","\n","![Insert Performance](https://github.com/christopherhuntley/BUAN6510/raw/master/img/L8_MySQL_Insert_Performance.png)\n","\n","If rollback does occur, then expect the process to take a while. Reverting 4.2 millions rows of data is not easy, especially if the server does not have enough swap space and in-memory cache.  \n","\n","![](https://github.com/christopherhuntley/BUAN6510/raw/master/img/L8_MySQL_Transaction_Rollback.png)\n","\n","\n","**4. Clean up.**\n","After we done with the import data, we can just drop the tables. \n","\n","![Clean Up Tables](https://github.com/christopherhuntley/BUAN6510/raw/master/img/L8_Clean_Up.png)\n","\n","### **Working with Dump Files**\n","\n","If the data already has been loaded into a database we can create a dump (archive) file. The process varies, but for MySQL it's packaged as a [separate utility](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/mysqldump.html), shown here in the MySQL Workbench app.\n","\n","![MySQL Dumps from Workbench](https://github.com/christopherhuntley/BUAN6510/raw/master/img/L8_MySQL_Dump_Workbench.png)\n","\n","The resulting dump file includes lots of SQL DDL and DML code that has been tuned to load as quickly as possible without errors. It can be treated like any other file, except that it may be many, many gigabytes in size. The process of restoring from a backup is the reverse of the dump file export.  \n","\n","![Restore from MySQL dump file](https://github.com/christopherhuntley/BUAN6510/raw/master/img/L8_Restore_Workbench.png)\n","\n","> **Heads up:** Since the dump file is an editable SQL script, we can alter the DDL statements (datatypes, constraints, etc.) to suit a different DBMS. The SQL DML is standard and does not need (much) fiddling. \n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"0Q7SD1cLz9ti"},"source":["### **Run a Few Queries**\n","Generally we would never use ad hoc `SELECT` queries with a large transactional database like this one, which is designed to writing data in small transactions. Instead, we would keep a data warehouse, with tables that have been selectively denormalized to better fit the needs of data analysts, \n","for that sort of thing. The data warehouse would extract and load data **in bulk** from this database, never one row at a time. (We will cover this common architectural design in Lessons 9 and 10.) Nonetheless, we can get surprisingly good `SELECT` query performance from even fairly complex queries.\n","\n","Here, for example, is a query that totals up the playing time for each player in the 2004-05 regular season and playoffs. A few complexities:\n","- Four tables and three joins, with millions rows of data being accessed and cross-referenced\n","- Grouping, with lots of subtotals tracks at once\n","- Sorting by a group
