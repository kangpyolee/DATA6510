designed to make it as simple and efficient as possible to *record* play by play statistics collected in the course of game. Each *play* is an event that can be *logged*. Each row of the table records each event, in the order they occured in the game. The columns then record the specifics of the event. \n","\n","Remarks about the `PlayLog` columns: \n","- `PlayLogID` (autogenerated by the database) and `play_id` (found in the raw source data) are unique to each play and can be treated as candidate keys or *indexes*. (We'll learn more about keys and indexes in Lesson 4.)\n","- `a1` - `a5` and `h1` -`h5` list which 5 players were on the court for the *away* team and the *home* team.  Each player name is unique for a given season, by the way. If there are two players with the same name -- yes, this has happened! -- then NBA stats department assigns each of the players a unique name. We'll treat the names like unique indexes for the players. \n","- `event_type` indicates what kinds of statistics can be drawn from the play. A \"shot\" for example is a made shot, a \"miss\" is a missed shot, etc. \n","- `player` records which player was the *subject* (initiator) of the event. If the `event_type`=\"rebound\" then the `player` is the one credited with the rebound.  \n","- `opponent` is is used in the event of a foul to indicate *who* on the opposing team was fouled.  \n","- `possession`, `steal`, `block` work like `opponent` in that they indicate another player involved in the play. If the play is a turnover , then the player that caused the turnover would appeat in one of these columns. \n","- `period` (quarter), `remaining_time` (in the period), `elapsed_time` (in the period) record the approximate time of the event wihin the game. For example, `period`=1 and `remaining_time`= \"9:58\" mean the event occured in the first quarter with 9 minutes and 58 seconds on the game clock. \n","- `shot_result`, `shot_distance`,\t`original_x`, `original_y`,\t`converted_x`, and\t`converted_y` are used to \"map\" the location of made and missed shots throughout a game. \n","- `play_description` is the text would apear in the play-by-play log in an app like ESPN Gamecast. \n","\n","\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"DDvsi32Mdyzx"},"source":["\n","Below each task in **bold** is a code cell.
