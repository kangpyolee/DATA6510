In the first sitting they'll type in some data into a couple of columns, then maybe add some formatting and perhaps column totals. Then they learn about copying cells with calculations in them, the proper use of `$` to freeze the row or column addresses, etc. Eventually, they'll perhaps learn about defining cell ranges as \"databases\" that can be dragged into PivotTables. It all seems so easy! Why not just stick with that? \n",

It is based on so-called Relational Algebra, which defines a set of rules and operations that should apply to tabular data (a.k.a., relations). SQL (or Sequel back then) was the programming language IBM used to implement the relational model.  \n",

        "In old-school data **files**, each line of text (it was always text or at least text-encoded) was called a **record**. Each record had some (possibly variable) number of **fields**, each representing one datum. Fields were delimited with a separator character, often a `tab` because it was not likely to be present in the data. A modern example is the so-called CSV file, where CSV stands for *comma -separated values*.\n",

A table is then a set of rows (tuples). **Within each tuple, every entity (row) in the domain is mapped to a value in each of the attribute codomains (columns with data types).** Further, there can be no row duplication; otherwise the relation would violate the first rule of sets. \n",

        "\n",

That not just hard to read, it's alsp really hard to debug. In practice we often will write the subquery first -- to make sure it works -- and then *wrap* the *main* query around it and hope that the subquery doesn't break. (Note: this approach doesn't work for correlated subqueries, which are forunately pretty rare.) \n",
