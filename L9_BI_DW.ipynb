It informs decision making at all levels of a firm. Given what we know now, how did it get that way and what can we do to get the results we desire? In other words, how can we use data to make us *smarter*? \n","\n","It is important to draw a distinction between BI and the broader world of Business Analytics. BI is **descriptive** (about things that are happening or have already happened) and to some degree **prescriptive** (what can be done now) but **very rarely predictive**. Where it does employ predictions, the models are more likely to be developed and tuned by data scientists with highly specialized training in machine learning and computer science.  \n","\n","An *apropos* analogy is the difference between accounting and finance. Accounting models are about accurately capturing the past and present (so it can be distilled into financial reports), while financial models are about the future (so we can make financial decisions that affect the future). While it is certainly possible for an accountant to know a lot about finance and a financial analyst to know a lot of accounting, they are nonetheless different professions. \n","\n","It's hard not to chuckle when people lump business intelligence in with database systems. Data visualization, probably *the* key feature for most BI apps, is in the presentation tier, not the data tier. Given access to lots of preprocessed data, with all the anomalies smoothed out, a BI dashboard allows us to see whatever stories the data can tell. That's very important $-$ literally why we collect, clean, and protect the data in the first place $-$ but about as much like a database app as whiffle ball is to baseball. They really are different things, with vastly different skill sets.\n","\n","![BI Pipelines](https://github.com/christopherhuntley/BUAN6510/raw/master/img/L9_Data_Pipelines.png)\n","\n","The process of collecting, curating, and repackaging data for consumption by business analysts is called a **pipeline**. Starting with raw data from various sources $-$ more on that in a moment $-$ the process flows through several layers of processing to distill the data down to just what the business analyst needs. While much of this \"sausage making\" process is designed and managed by data engineers, it is (or should be) with the guidance and insights of data analysts. After all, who else really knows what the end product is supposed to be? \n","\n","In this lesson we will focus on data pipelines, starting with the general challenges and then highlighting the functional and technical differences between the layers.

As we have gotten more familiar with the pitfalls of massive datasets, the  list has [expanded to seven](https://towardsdatascience.com/modern-unified-data-architecture-38182304afcc), each motivated by plenty of war stories:\n","\n","- **Variety**. Data can come from various disconnected sources, each of which makes its own assumptions about the domain. Even within a given domain, assumptions may change over time. So, what was perfectly valid data a decade ago is not necessarily useful today. \n","- **Velocity**. Modern online systems are really, really good at collecting data. It is like the data tier is trying to \"drink from a firehose\" as it sorts through it all in real-time. Anything that is not stored is lost, and not everything can be stored. We have to make hard decisions sometimes. \n","- **Volume**. The shear size of the datasets can be difficult to deal with. We saw that when trying to load the PlayLog database in Lesson 8. The dataset was large enough that only part of the data could be loaded at a time. Otherwise, we risked completely filling up the server. In fact, a server reboot was needed to finish the job. \n","- **Visibility**. There are always going to be new uses for a given dataset. Each time we try to support a new app or new model we may need a new interface, with data formatted a certain way, perhaps with data that has never been shared before. That opens up all sorts of potential bugs and other pitfalls. \n","- **Veracity**. Data can lie. No matter how much we can try to validate every fact, some bugs are going to remain. These kinds of bugs are unknowable and won't surface until uncovered by an application that tries to use the data. \n","- **Vulnerability**. As businesses become more and more dependent on data, the data itself becomes more and more enticing for cyber criminals. Even if they don't hold the data hostage, they may steal secrets that are best left hidden. \n","- **Value**. It is tempting to just dump everything you have into an over-engineered uber data warehouse. However, needs will inevitably change, requiring continual redesign. Maintenance is then a continual process, with each added design feature a potential liability. If a feature does not provide value, then kill it before it becomes a problem instead of a solution. \n","\n","While any given dataset may be subject to any of these issues, the risks go up exponentially with more data, compounding with each row of data. In other words ...\n","\n","**If it's big data, assume it's pig ugly and expect to spend 80% of your time applying lots of lipstick.**\n","\n","\n"," \n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"yUNZeFcYCU9A"},"source":["## **Lakes, Warehouses, and Marts**\n","\n","An enterprise-scale pipeline starts in the **data lake** layer, progresses through to a **data warehouse** layer, and then ends with a **data mart** layer. It is possible that a given company may combine or even skip one of these layers, of course. \n","\n","Many of the most common architectural choices are laid out in the table below. \n","\n","|  | Data Lake | Data Warehouse | Data Mart |\n","|---|---|---|---|\n","| **Objective** | Retain Everything | Curate & Integrate Content | Package for Use |\n","| **User Access** | Read-Write | Read-only | Read-Write (views and extracts) |\n","| **Structured Data**| SQL | SQL, OLAP Cubes | SQL, spreadsheets |\n","| **Semi-Structured Data** | JSON, Docs, NoSQL, APIs| SQL (with Extensions), Object-Relational DBs | SQL (with Extensions), NoSQL, Spreadsheets |\n","| **Unstructured Data** | Docs, Text Files, Streams | N/A | NoSQL, Reports |\n","| **Time Scale** | Now/Online | Historical, Online | Historical |\n","| **Storage Requirements** | Petabytes/Terabytes | Terabytes/Gigabytes | Gigabytes/Megabytes |\n","| **Storage Strategy** | Files + Row Stores | Column Stores | Documents / Various |\n","| **Example Tech** |  MySQL, PostgreSQL, AWS DynamoDB, etc. | GCP BigQuery, AWS Dynamo, etc. | Google Sheets, DropBox Files, etc.|\n","\n","### **Functional Differences**\n","\n","A **data lake** is a repository for just about any kind of data. A conscious effort is made to retain the data in its original state, including all the bugs and other errors. \n","\n","A **data warehouse** is intended as the one true source for all data. It draws from the data lake but then uses business logic to clean it of errors, enrich it with summary facts, and integrate it into a coherent whole. The cleaning and integration are performed as part of the ETL process that loads data into the warehouse. It is important to note that all data enters the data warehouse through the ETL processes. To everything else, access to the data warehouse is strictly read-only.\n","\n","**Data marts** are generated (extracted) from the data warehouse. Since the warehouse ensures that the data is clean and consistent, there is no need to keep data in a normalized form. In fact, it is usually best to denormalize the data as much as possible (i.e., one table with lots of possibly redundant columns) so as to avoid complex query logic. We can safely do this because the data is never fed back into the data warehouse. The extraction processes that feed the data marts are read-only users just like everybody else.  \n","\n","### **Data Structure and Format Differences**\n","How the data is stored and processed depends in part on the degree of structure.\n","\n","**Structured data** is organized into datasets with a fixed data data model (*schema*). Ideally, the data comes from a well-designed relational database so that we can at least assume that it is free of anomalies. If a change is made to the schema then the data is restructured to match. Thus, we always know what the schema is *before writing new data* to a dataset.  \n","\n","In general, structured data is best kept in a relational database, though there are sometimes reasons to consider alternatives. For example, graph databases are excellent at storing geo-spatial data. It is still highly structured, except the schema is not relational. \n","\n","**Semi-structured data** has metadata and perhaps a schema but there is no attempt to retain consistency over time. In other words, each datum may have its own schema, which *might not be known until the data is read*. This of course can cause some data integration and retrieval/search issues. \n","\n","The classic example of a semistructured data format is JSON, which organizes data into hierarchies (trees) of indeterminate depth. It *is* certainly possible to have a consistent structure in JSON but it is not guaranteed.\n","\n","**Unstructured data** does not have any schema at all. Raw text from a social media stream, for example, can be about anything. Similarly, photos that have not been tagged for content are just collections of pixels and lines. Data retrieval then becomes a matter of luck and intuition rather than a repeatable process. \n","\n","### **Performance Requirements and Technology Differences**\n","At Big Data scale raw performance matters, and how to best deliver that performance depends on where we are in the pipeline. \n","\n","In a data lake the emphasis is capturing and storing (writing) data in close to real time. That means any storage strategy needs to accept *serialized* data in the order it is collected. Files are transmitted in serialized form anyway, so they can be stored as is. Relational data (i.e., in a relational database) comes in one transaction at a time, adding rows with each transaction.  MySQL, for example, is tuned to operate this way. It writes (and reads) individual rows of data really quickly. \n","\n","In a data warehouse the emphasis is on making queries run as fast as possible. Since most queries only use a few columns at a time, the best way to [structure the data is in columns](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Column-oriented_DBMS). BigQuery, for example, uses this strategy to good effect, sometimes offering orders of magnitude speedup over MySQL for the same `SELECT` query. (Python programmers should also note that *pandas* also uses a column-oriented strategy: a DataFrame is equivalent to a dictionary of lists, one list per column.)\n","\n","In a data mart the best strategy depends entirely on the applications. In many cases it might be best to avoid using a database at all, making data available as CSV files, spreadsheets, or other document formats. In any case, the datasets (or databases) themselves are rarely large enough to make performance an issue.\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"DKpvT0vaTrwH"},"source":["---\n","## **NBA PlayFacts Data Warehouse**\n","### **Designed for Analytics**\n","Any data warehouse is only as useful as the questions it answers. Whenever possible it should \n","- make calculating aggregate statistics as easy as possible using simple sums, averages, etc.\n","- allow the data to be grouped (labelled) in various ways that make sense to analysts\n","- allow statistics to be disaggregated to identify the base-level source data\n","- use keys and other indexes that are **idempotent** (i.e., time invariant) so that a report from years ago can be rerun today without a major redesign\n","\n","These requirements lead most naturally to a star schema design where:\n","- There is a central **fact table** with possibly many columns of precomputed aggregable measures (facts) and dimensional labels (foreign keys) that can be used to describe and categorize the facts. The fact table is fine grained, with the facts as atomic as possible. In the stereotypical data warehouse the fact table might have millions of rows. It is also likely to be highly normalized to eliminate potential double-counting errors due to data redundancy. \n","- The fact table is surrounded by **dimension tables** that provide the labels and possibly more descriptive detail. The dimension tables are denormalized to eliminate unnecessary relationships. Usually, each dimension is much smaller than the facts table, with a modest number of rows that rarely change.  \n","\n","We call such a database a **Dimensional Data Warehouse**, which we will go into in more detail in Lesson 10. \n","\n","The ERD for the NBA PlayFacts warehouse is shown below:\n","- `PlayFact` corresponds to `Event` in the `PlayLog` ERD. In a `SELECT` query the facts are what we would aggregate to calculate statistics like a box score. \n","- The `Game`,`Team`,`Lineup`, and `Player` dimensions surrounding `PlayFact` represent different ways to aggregate the facts. In a `SELECT` query we would join in these tables as needed, using the primary keys in the `GROUP BY` clause. \n","- The `players_list` attribute is literally a text string with a listing of the players in alphabetical order.  \n","- Any relationships between the dimensions (e.g, games and teams) have been eliminated through selective denormalization.\n","\n","![NBA PlayFacts Dim DW](https://github.com/christopherhuntley/BUAN6510/raw/master/img/L9_NBA_PlayFacts_Star_DW.png\n",")\n","\n","So, why do we want this dimensional design? Because it reduces the vast majority of queries to something like this:\n","```sql\n","SELECT grouping_columns, aggregate_columns \n","FROM play_facts\n","      JOIN games USING (game_id)\n","      JOIN teams USING (team_id)\n","      JOIN lineups USING (lineup_id)\n","      JOIN players USING (player_id)\n","WHERE row_conditions\n","GROUP BY group_columns\n","HAVING group_conditions\n","```\n","\n","The joins, which are where most `SELECT` queries go awry, can be the same every time.

All the analyst has to do is fill in a few details into the template:\n","- the columns to use for the grouping\n","- the columns and functions for the aggregates\n","- the conditions for the rows and groups\n","\n","These details can be configured via a form interface, which usually ends up looking a lot like the ones used for Excel PivotTables. What could be more convenient (and bulletproof) than that?\n","![](https://github.com/christopherhuntley/BUAN6510/raw/master/img/L2_excel_pivot_table.png)\n","\n","*Source: the MS Excel documentation.*\n","\n","### **ETL Processes**\n","\n","Here we will consider two different possibilities for the NBA PlayFacts warehouse. \n","\n","#### **Transactional RDBMS $\\rightarrow$ Dimensional DW**\n","Ideally, the source data is already in a DBMS with properly normalized tables. \n","\n","![Trans 2 Dim ETL](https://github.com/christopherhuntley/BUAN6510/raw/master/img/L9_ETL_from_RDBMS.png)\n","\n","In this case we can use SQL queries to populate the warehouse tables directly from the existing database. \n","- The `play_facts` table is mostly based on the PlayLog `events` table, with information from the `play_segments` and `shot_events` tables blended in for convenience. Since the PlayLog database was highly normalized there is little chance of denormalization causing a data anomaly. \n","- The dimension tables are just slightly denormalized versions of their equivalents in the PlayLog database.\n","\n","The following partial SQL snippet creates the `play_facts` table from tables extracted from the PlayLog database:\n","```sql\n","INSERT INTO play_facts (game_id, team_id, ..., p_points, ...)\n","SELECT game_id, team_id, ... \n","       CASE ... AS p_points,\n","       ...\n","FROM events\n","     JOIN play_segments USING (play_seg_id)\n","     LEFT JOIN `shot_events` USING (event_id);\n","```\n","\n","There is actually quite a bit of code hidden behind the ellipses (...) but this shows the general pattern: keys copied from existing tables with statistical facts calculated with CASE expressions and functions. \n","\n","To keep the queries from getting out of hand, it may be simpler to work in stages, with a first stage that creates the fact rows with the necessary keys, a second stage that updates some of the fact columns, a third stage that handles a few more, etc. This allows each query to be relatively simple, working on a few columns at a time. It also allows some of the earlier stages to inform the later ones, building up complex calculations from simpler ones. \n","\n","#### **Data Files $\\rightarrow$ Dimensional DW**\n","\n","The process of loading from CSV files is a bit more laborious. \n","- Since they have not been normalized there is a high potential for data integrity errors. Just one misspelling, negative clock time, missing event type, etc. could trigger a series of errors that we really don't want in our data warehouse. \n","- The data may be spread among many files, with slightly different file formats, column names, etc. In the case of the NBA PlayLog data, there were 20,581 CSV files covering 16 years. The reporting standards had changed a bit over the years. For example, dates went from `mm/dd/yyyy` format to `yyyy-mm-dd` format in 2008.\n","\n","Given the logical complexities of loading, integrating, validating, and cleaning a data set of this size, we cannot rely on a manual process. In fact, since there will likely be unexpected errors along the way that invalidate everything, we should expect to have to debug and repeat the process *from the beginning* many times before we are done. \n","\n","The NBA PlayLog ETL process was implemented in Python, making liberal use of pandas to do SQL-like tasks like indexing rows, checking columns for uniqueness, detecting invalid player names, etc.  Essentially, pandas DataFrames are used as an intermediary that acts like an in-memory data warehouse before exporting data into data marts. \n","\n","The snippet of code below loads each of the 20,581 CSV files, does some minor corrections, and dumps each year of data as a fully denormalized fact table:\n","\n","![Load CSVs in Python](https://github.com/christopherhuntley/BUAN6510/raw/master/img/L9_PlayLog_load_Python.png)\n","   \n","The dimensional data is still there, just blended in with the facts. Each CSV file is monstrously huge but can fit in 8 gigabytes of memory. A better solution is to use something like Google BigQuery to hold the data in a columnar database (with year-by-year partitions), but there will always be Pythonistas that prefer CSV files to SQL queries.   \n","\n","### **Extraction into Data Marts**\n","\n","Creating a data mart from a data warehouse is generally pretty straightforward. In many cases it comes down to a few `SELECT` queries with strategically chosen `GROUP BY` clauses and aggregate calculations. \n","\n","For the NBA PlayFacts warehouse, we could create a data mart based on just about any of the dimensions: \n","- By game, season, or year\n","- By player, lineup, or team\n","\n","All we need is the grouping logic and a process to calculate the group-wise aggregates. \n","\n","We already explored just such a data mart in Lesson 3, where the `play_facts` data was grouped by lineup and year.
