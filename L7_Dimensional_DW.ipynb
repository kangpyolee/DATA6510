        "\n",
        "Data Warehousing as the \"one true source of truth\" is an idea that goes all the way back to the 1980s. Analysts had by that point built up quite a repertoire of models for just about any kind of analysis. They could create classification and regression trees (decision trees, random forests, etc.). They could do linear, nonlinear, kernel, and logistic regression with large datasets. They could solve optimization problems with thousands of variables and tens of thousands of constraints. Even the neural network models at the core of the latest and greatest deep learning techniques were pretty mature by 1994.  \n",
        "\n",
        "What was missing was data! Well, sort of. Mainframe systems had been collecting transaction data for decades. Every day, banks and credit card companies were processing millions of transactions, transportation systems were tracking hundreds of thousands of shipments, etc. All we had to do was archive it all so we could analyze it later. Or so it seemed to most of us. \n",

There is a huge table in the center with lots of columns and foreign key relationships to  smaller tables around the periphery. This general pattern is called a **star schema**. A relational database that implements the star schema pattern (or one of its variants) is called a dimensional data warehouse.\n",
        "\n",
        "> **Heads Up**: The star schema is a **design pattern, a standard solution to a standard problem.** By standardizing what they call these solutions, designers can communicate among themselves with just a few words instead of re-explaining the details every time. It is both more efficient and potentially less error-prone, as any standard should be.   \n",
        "\n",
        "The Star Schema pattern features two kinds of tables:\n",
        "- **A fact table with precomputed quantitative measures.** The measures themselves are somewhat volatile, with new measures continually added and others redefined to suit the ever changing needs of the analysts. If there is a way to precompute a statistic or other measure so analysts don't have to, then do it. If a given measure is no longer needed or misleading, then we redefine or remove it. \n",
        "- **Dimension tables that provide context for the facts.** Dimensions are somewhat timeless and immutable. Even when the facts themselves may change over time, the dimensions remain relatively static. \n",
        "\n",
        "Generally, the fact table has a foreign key reference to each of the dimension tables. Dimension tables, meanwhile, stand on their own, without any foreign keys. \n",

        "The star schema addresses the disconnect between the way data is recorded versus how it is used by analysts. It reduces all data down to measures (facts) and context (dimensions).

Since they are often fairly small (relative to the fact table) and don't change much, there is little chance of creating anomalies over time. So, while it may be tempting to, for example, normalize out zip codes and cities from a location dimension, there is no real need, especially when it would require an unnecessary table join.\n",

        "Like a lot of things, it depends.  \n",
        "\n",
        "**When to combine dimensions:** Some dimensions may permit several levels of *granularity*. For example, a given office is in a region, which is in a division, etc. To borrow terminology from normalization, we say that there is a chain of functional dependencies: office $\\rightarrow$ region $\\rightarrow$ division. The recommendation is to keep the levels together in a single dimension table rather than separate them out. \n",
        "> This would apply, for example, to the way NBA teams are grouped into *divisions* and *conferences* (Eastern or Western) that affect scheduling decisions. In other words, team $\\rightarrow$ division $\\rightarrow$ conference. Since each group nests cleanly inside the next, there is no need to separate them. \n",
        "\n",
        "**When to separate into multiple dimensions:** Within a company the *location* of a fact can mean geolocation (addresses) or a spot in organizational hierarchy (functional area, group, etc.). While they are both location dimensions, they are not logically connected via a functional dependency. They should reside in separate dimension tables, not one. \n",
        "> We have already seen this case with the NBA players, lineups, and teams. There are many-to-many relationships among them, making it impossible to create a consistent functional dependency chain; they don't nest together cleanly. \n",

        "### **Slowly Changing Dimensions**\n",
        "\n",
        "There are plenty of specialized types of dimensions (conformed, role-playing, junk, etc.) that serve different purposes. Most of the time, however, we are working with so-called **_slow moving_** dimensions where the rows and columns don't change much over time. Often such dimensions can be maintained by hand or perhaps via a periodic updating process. \n",
        "\n",
        "For example, while NBA players do occasionally move from team to team or sign \"10 day contracts\" to replace injured players, for the most part the team rosters do not change much during the season. We can maintain them as needed, starting with a preliminary roster at the start of the seaosn and then adding to it as new players join the team. \n",
        "\n",

        "- For binary data (pictures, etc.), the options are very limited, though one may be able to apply a machine learning technique to generate numerical digests that can be aggregated.  \n",
        "\n",
        "Interestingly, the fact table can only be as **granular** as the **dimensions** allow. In other words, if a given dimension only has 3 possible labels (rows), then that dimension can only divide up the facts three ways. We can, however, increase the granularity by adding **new** dimensions. Each additional dimension potentially increases the granularity but never decreases it. Alternatively, we can increase the granularity by adding strategically selected rows to an **existing** dimension. \n",
        "\n",
        "One way to visualize this is with a (hyper-) cube, with each dimension on a side. Each fact is *binned* inside one of the smaller cubes at the intersection of the dimensions. For the NBA PlayFacts cube below, each fact is binned based on the game, team, and player. Thus, if with only three dimensions, we would only be able to generate box score stats for full games. In order to get statistics within a game (e.g., for the last two minutes of each period) we would need to include a *play segment* dimension. (Don't ask about how we'd show a 4-dimensional cube. Just know that we can.) Thus, by adding a dimension we have also increased the granularity. \n",

        "> **Heads Up:** It is sometimes difficult to distinguish dimensions from measures when source data is numerical. For example, is the time on the clock (i.e., seconds remaining in the period) a measure or a dimension? It is a measure, in the sense that it captures the passage of time, but it is also a dimension, in that it records when a given event happened. The key when considering whether any given quantity belongs on the fact table is to ask whether you would i) aggregate it (sum, average, etc.) or ii) cite it. In a basketball game it is the latter (cited), so we separate it out into the play segment dimension. The clock *interval* between events (elapsed time), however, is something that we can sum up by quarter, player, etc. Thus, it belongs on the fact table.  \n",

        "> **Heads Up**: The terms \"rollup\" and \"drilldown\" were coined by vendors of OLAP (OnLine Analytical Processing) systems that do real-time ETL from transaction data but the terms can be readily applied to any dimensional data warehouse.\n",
        "\n",
        "A **rollup** is the standard `GROUP BY` aggregation operation. The idea is that a whole stripe of data in the cube (i.e., a dimension) is \"rolled up\" like a carpet and then replaced with summary data. We can do this for several dimensions at a time to get summarized data of various purposes. \n",
        "\n",
        "A **drilldown** is the opposite of a rollup. Starting with aggregate data, a drilldown disaggregates it to a finer level of granularity. Behind the scenes, it is the same as a rollup, just with a lower level of aggregation. Ultimately, the lowest level of a drilldown is the fact table itself. \n",

However, with the advent of cheap cloud-based data storage, cost becomes less important than performance. Thus, we may choose to denormalize everything into a single table (or materialized view) that doesn't require any expensive joins. It's simple enough. If we already have the data in a normalized form, then we would just need to join in every table and select every column to generate a new \"one table fits all\" data warehouse. \n",

        "- **If care is taken to *use just foreign keys in the `GROUP BY` clause*, then it can *sometimes* be actually be faster to query multiple tables than a single table.** This is because the joins will happen **after** the grouping has reduced the data to a manageable number of fact table rows. The incremental performance cost of the join is then practically nil, especially if there are a small number of groups in the result set. \n",
        "- **Dimension tables provide opportunities to add in static descriptive data.** For example, we could add in the seating capacity or age of a given basketball arena if we treat it as a dimension table instead of just a column. If an arena were just a few columns then we'd have to update the view each time we added a column. \n",
        "\n",

Among other things this means that attributes should be singular, represeting just one fact about a given entity. Plural attributes, meanwhile, should be normalized out into one-to-many relationships to new entity types. \n",

        "The `ARRAY` and `STRUCT` collection types (details below) were added to the SQL standards in a wave of enthusiasm for object-relational features in SQL:1999 but then (like window functions) largely ignored by most database vendors until 2018. Why ignore the standard? Because collection types permit us to skirt around a fundamental law of normalization: thou shalt not use repeated fields. \n",
        "\n",
        "In fact, it is not a good idea to use these sorts of collection types in a transactional database, where vigilance is needed to keep the data consistent and anomaly free. However, for dimensional data warehouses, where the **dimension tables** are often denormalized anyway, they make **perfect sense**: no extra joins, no redundant columns, etc., just the relevant context in a concise format.  \n",
        "\n",
        "> **Heads Up**: Collection types are generally **not a good fit for fact tables** because they complicate the aggregation logic. What does a **measure** (i.e., fact) mean when it can be multi-valued? How do you sum or average a list of lists? \n",
        "\n",
        "***Technically*, collection types do not actually violate normalization rules.** A collection is a **container** that can hold structured data. The container itself is singular, though the contents might be plural. It's like how you might keep a plastic *container* of cut celery sticks instead of storing them in a pile on the shelf. The container is *one* thing (with the sticks nested inside), but you have to open the container (unpack it) to get your snack. That's exactly how SQL `ARRAY` and `STRUCT` work. We have to use functions and special syntax to pack and unpack data. Otherwise, SQL just treats it like an image or other binary data. Of course, it *is* still a problem that we don't know what's inside the container before we unpack it but we can still say the table itself is 1NF. \n",
